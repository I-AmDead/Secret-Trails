    <text>Thanks for your help stalker! If you hadn't shown up I'd be a dead man by now.</text>

    <text>Thanks for the information.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_1501">
    <text>Yes I heard about that. They even say he used to work in these parts and that Arrow's stash is in a local basement. Rumor has it that his group was based there too.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_1502">
    <text>This is one of the many entrances which will lead you into the interconnected cellers. Once you're in there you're on your own. I don't have a map and the celler network is huge and really confusing.</text>

    <text>Yeah, we looked for it too, but couldn't find it. I'll send you some information about it. That's everything we have on the stash.</text>

    <text>We're fighting or more specifically camping out like sitting ducks. Talk to Mole if you want to know more, he's the leader.</text>

    <text>Man, that was a fight and a half, you wouldn't wish something like that on your worst enemy. Those army boys are getting pretty cocky!</text>

    <text>Where is the Agroprom Research Institute?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_10">
    <text>Not far from here. Follow the road to the west and you'll come to the Institute's gates.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_100">
    <text>I hear the military have set up a base there, right?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_120">
    <text>Thanks for the information.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_20">
    <text>Yeah, there's a military base there. I'm not sure how many of them there are exactly ,but it's at least a platoon. They're well-armed and you've got no chance of breaking through. They'll take you down before you can say 'hello comrades'. The best way of getting in is during the night because the base is well guarded during the day. They have checkpoints everywhere, and anyway, I heard a deserter soldier from that base is hiding in the marshes. If you can find him I'm sure you can shake some useful info out of him.</text>

    <text>What's going on?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_krot_actor_hasnot_met_seriy_100">
    <text>Me and my boys found a nice little area full of artifacts, but those army bastards attacked us for some reason. I don't know what the hell they wanted from us.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_krot_actor_hasnot_met_seriy_200">
    <text>Yeah, I've heard about him. I think he used to make his living in this area. It's quite a nice place actually. He left a long time ago. I don't know when it was exactly and I've got no clue where he was headed. That's everything I can tell you.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_krot_actor_hasnot_met_seriy_2000">
    <text>You weren't waiting here for no reason, were you? Otherwise why would the military comandos show up here?</text>

<string id="agr_krot_actor_hasnot_met_seriy_250">
    <text>Okay, I know something about Arrow.</text>
</string>

    <text>Yeah? I really need to know that.</text>

    <text>If you lied to me I'll find you and finish what the soldiers couldn't!</text>

    <text>I'm not lying. I know that nobody trusts anyone here, so you have little choice about lying.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_krot_actor_met_seriy_100">
    <text>Seryi? Well, Ok, listen. They say Arrow used to sneak around here. On top of that, his stash is somewhere around here below ground. I heard his group even has its base here. We also looked for the stash but we found jack shit. I'll give you the information about the stash, maybe you'll be luckier. This is everything we have on the stash location.</text>

    <text>I don't know anything else. I told you everything I know and now you have to work it out on your own. Good luck to you.</text>

    <text>What are you doing?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_esc_20">
    <text>I'm coming back from the factory which is a bit further down the road. I don't know how but the army found out about our group. I didn't wait for them to show up and took off as quickly as I could. I hope our boys got out of there 'cause otherwise they won't be alive for much longer - you saw the choppers yourself.</text>

    <text>I've got a couple of questions.</text>

    <text>What do you want to know?</text>

<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_1000">
    <text>Anything interesting in the area?</text>

<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_120">
    <text>How much do you want?</text>

<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_130">
    <text>Here take the money. Now tell me where it is.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_131">
    <text>Piss off!</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_140">
    <text>Thank you!</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_20">
    <text>Yeah there are a couple of places, but you'll have to share some of your wealth buddy.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_21">
    <text>It used to be pretty quiet, but now the army has got all excited and started wasting everyone. They smoked the bandits out recently. I hear some of the bandits managed to escape into the catacombs.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_30">
    <text>Thirty, deal?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_40">
    <text>The exit from the railway tunnel is nearby. It's fairly safe at the dead end. At least nobody has been eaten while sleeping yet. Also, to the northwest of the factory you'll find a swamp with a wagon in it. Be careful there's a shitload of radiation around it, so it's best to approach it from the western side. Oh and one more thing, a soldier has been spotted there. He's likely to be from the military base at the Institute. The poor bastard is probably crazy. He's been there for a couple of days and I doubt he'll survive much longer on his own.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_9999">
    <text>See ya!</text>

    <text>Do you know about Rat? This information will cost you 30 rubles.</text>
</string>

    <text>Deal.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher1_111">
    <text>We have a local hero around here called Rat. He lives in the marshes. The man bred so many rats in the collectors that he'll soon let them out to eat those army bastards.</text>

    <text>Great, thanks.</text>

    <text>Tell me more about the collectors.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher1_11121">
    <text>Collectors are your standard shit-stinking sewers that take waste from the Institute and dumps it in the nearest water reservoir. </text>

    <text>Great. See you around,and take care of yourself.</text>

    <text>Nothing, absolutely nothing.</text>

    <text>I see, bye!</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_0">
    <text>Tell me about this place.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_1">
    <text>This is the area around the Agroprom Research Institute. The Institute itself is to the Southwest. The factory which served as the Institute's technical production facility is to the North. The buildings have been abandoned for a long time and there's nothing to be found there, but the army has been searching there very actively recently.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_2">
    <text>Tell me more about the Institute.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_21">
    <text>There are loads of legends about the Institute. Before the accident in 1986 the only thing there was the Institute of Genetics Selection and Genetics. The area where the factory is now was used for experimental crop fields. After the accident, they closed the Institute and burned the fields. Then they remembered about it and came back. They whitewashed the building, put up a fence around it and built some barracks. I don't know what they now do at the Institute but they didn't have any shortage of funding that's for sure.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_3">
    <text>Tell me more about the factory.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_31">
    <text>The factory was built at the end of the 80's. They said it was going to be used to build and test machines that could treat soil affected by radiation. As far as I know nobody ever saw a single machine come out of that plant. It's totally empty now, which makes it a favorite spot for stalkers. I hear the place is pretty safe as long as you avoid the dark corners.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_4">
    <text>Thanks.</text>

<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_0">
    <text>What are you doing?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_10">
    <text>I'm hiding here, I don't want any trouble.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_100">
    <text>Who are you hiding from?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_120">
    <text>Catacombs?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_130">
    <text>Do you know where they keep documents at the Institute?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_140">
    <text>What are you going to do now?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_141">
    <text>What are you going to do now?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_20">
    <text>I am from the recon unit. They sent us into the catacombs to see what's going on below the base. It's hell down there I'm telling you. I was the only one to get out of there, everyone else is probably dead by now. I don't want to go back to the base, those bastards are always using us to plug up all the holes in this damn Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_30">
    <text>Underground tunnels. They go from the Institute to the area around it. I'll show you the entrances. I don't have maps of the catacombs themselves.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_40">
    <text>At the HQ. It's on the third floor of the Institute. That's where they keep those damn papers. But it's a bitch getting in there. By day the area is teaming with patrols, but not as much at night. I'll tell you this for free, if you wanna get inside you'll have to go through the catacombs, you stand no chance at the gate.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_50">
    <text>Hmm, I don't know. I am a deserter according to the military code and I need to get out of the Zone somehow. When we first got here there was a ZAZ 1103 (car) in the garage that was almost working. I brought it back to life in half an hour but that damn captain took it for himself claiming he should have it according to the code. He drove it along this road and left it in the rain by the gate. If only I could get that car. Making a run for it is much safer on wheels!</text>

<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks1_0">
    <text>Hello!</text>

<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks1_01">
    <text>What's up?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks1_011">
    <text>Tell me about the collector (sewer). How do I get inside? Where are the exits and entrances?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks1_0111">
    <text>It's dangerous inside the collector. There are six entrances and two of them are in the area around the Institute where the military have set up a base. That area is patrolled and the captain keeps the patrol schedule in his armory.</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks1_01111">
    <text>How do you know all that?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks1_011111">

    <text>Who are you?</text>

<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks1_0134">
    <text>I live here, if you can call this a life. I breed rats in the collector to annoy the military at the Institute.</text>

    <text>Have you heard any latest news or stories?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_krot_story_1">
    <text>Yeah, there is an amusing one. Once I was walking through the Dark Valley, actually returning to our camp. By that time it became almost full dark, not a thing could be seen. Then, finally, a bonfire comes into view up ahead. Yeah, about time for a hungry and tired stalker to meet his companions! Just at the moment I was walking along big bushes growing by the road, and suddenly saw a kind of human shadow slightly move. Seems like a bandit is spying again. Later he'll report to his boss to be rewarded with a gun or money and the stalkers camp will be destroyed. So I came up with the desision to scare the hell out of him. The bastard must be taught a lesson! So very quietly I am sneaking towards the bandit from behind performing a tight circle around thim and whispering: 'What the hell are you doing here, dogmeat?'. 'Grrrahhhh ...' was the answer. Well, that's expected. Meet my professional grip, if you can even say a word, you're superman, heh. By the way the guy was smelling like a fifty year old zombie. Awful! Probably deficated. Well I eased my grip a little and said: 'The next time I see you here brut I'll blow your brains out, if there's anything in it, understood?'. And suddenly this smelling guy answers hoarsly: 'Hey, what's up, man? Let me go! Can't an innocent guy just take a quiet piss?!'.</text>

<string id="agr_krot_story_2">
    <text>Heh, that's some kind of a story...</text>
