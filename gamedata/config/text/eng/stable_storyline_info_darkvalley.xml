    <text>Barkeep: "According to the documents you brought from Agroprom, things are starting to clear up, but some data is missing. There is evidence to suggest the presence of a Brain Scorcher which blocks the road to the North, but no one knows exactly what it is. Also, there is mention of Lab X18 whose description matches that of abandoned underground structures in the Dark Valley. Its present activity is unknown and besides, bandits have now set up their base in the Dark Valley.\n Several Duty scouts went there very recently, but so far there is no news from them.\n To get inside the lab, you will need two electronic keys; I will give you one, but the second one you will have to take from Borov, the bandit leader. \n\n So, you need to take the second key to the lab from Borov, then sneak inside the lab and get the documents.</text>

    <text>A week ago it was decided to increase the intensity of radiation on the test subjects. No changes were detected in the first few days. After several days strange metamorphoses started to occur: hair loss, heightened aggressiveness. Several subjects were literally trampled by their peers.</text>
</string>
<string id="documents_2">
    <text>Subject's condition is stable. The amount of hair is now 10% of the original amount. Their claws and teeth have grown considerably. Bursts of activity exhibit seemingly random behavior and are not directed at their peers. Senior lab technician A.N. Burnov speculated that this may indicate an increase in the subject's intellect. It was decided to test the new modulation of psy-emissions on the subjects.</text>

    <text>Chief of Security: Yesterday security guard G.P. Glebov tossed a piece of meat to the subjects just for fun. They tore apart and devoured it in mere seconds. Subsequently several individuals tried to break out of the cells. Because of this, lab technicians were unable to obtain the necessary test samples. Although G.P. Glebov's actions were ill-considered, I propose that maintenance personnel be equipped with airguns for adequate protection in the event of emergencies.</text>

    <text>Chief of Security: Yesterday the experiment almost got out of control. Two dozen test subjects broke out and vandalised two laboratory rooms. Fortunately the research personnel were able to lock themselves up upstairs. We were ordered to clear the main laboratory room. In the course of the operation, three guards suffered bites. Hopefully, they will be OK. I wish the experiment is soon over.</text>

<string id="documents_5">
    <text>Yesterday we delivered a new modulation of Psy-emissions to the test subjects. It appeared as though their brains simply got roasted. I can hardly imagine how this emission would affect humans. We have tested every type of emission and the results match those obtained in other laboratories. The experiment can now be considered complete. Presumably, in one week's time, we will be ready to conduct the experiment on larger creatures.</text>

<string id="sl_x18_dream_text">
    <text>Had a strange dream. The colossal Chernobyl power plant emerges in the twilight. Everything looked peaceful. A lonely man appears. I see him from behind against the background of the plant. The wind starts to blow. Suddenly hordes of rats begin to skitter away from the station in all directions. The man with his back still turned to me and shoots at the rats. There is an abrupt scream, 'Strelok!'. The man shudders, freezes for a moment, then starts to turn slowly in my direction, but... just an instant before I am to get a glance at his face, I wake up. What does this dream mean? I don't know, but I think it's something I have seen before.</text>

    <text>Hmm ... Lab X-18 wasn't fun...and its current residents...I didn't think things like that existed. I found some documents. I didn't understand much of what was written in there except that they contained technical specifications for some components for Kaimanov emitters. What's interesting is that the parts were destined for another lab with the codename X-16 and it's probably a secret one too.</text>
