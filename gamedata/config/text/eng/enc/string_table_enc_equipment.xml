    <text>This amazing device allows detecting many living forms, both warm-blooded and cold-blooded, at a distance of up to 50 meters. The principle of its operation is described in detail in the monograph of Professor Bolshakov "Practical application of the unique properties of the artifact ZX-232 'Crystal Ball' in field conditions", as well as in the dissertation of Assistant Semenov "Biological organisms as natural transceivers of radio waves". Briefly, the operation of the device can be described as follows: Most living organisms emit electromagnetic waves during movement, which can be direction-found to measure their frequency, intensity, and determine the position of the source in space. During muscle work, electrical impulses flow along the nerve fiber to the muscle bundle, and living tissues, as well as tissues in which current conductivity is preserved, become micro-transmitters. For a quite long time, it was believed that due to the extreme weakness of the signals, they could only be detected in laboratory conditions using bulky amplifying equipment. So-called "auroscopes" worked and work on this principle - instruments recording the "aura" around a living body, which is, in fact, electromagnetic radiation of a certain range. \n\nIn the course of researching various artifacts of the Zone, scientists stumbled upon an extremely interesting effect of one artifact - the "Crystal Ball". Assistant Semenov's small pocket radio completely unexpectedly began to receive a signal from a private radio station located in one of the provincial districts of Argentina. Having studied the unusual phenomenon, the scientific camp team came to the only probable explanation: the "Crystal Ball" artifact amplifies and filters an ordered radio signal from interference. Obviously, a microscopic part of the signal from the Argentine radio point was present at the camp's location, but it was so small that no powerful receivers could fix it. However, one only had to bring the "Crystal Ball" to the stationary communication console of the camp, as hundreds of voices began to be heard from the noise of the ether, upon further tuning successfully filtered and turning out to be signals of almost all radio transmitters available in the range of the communication console, the most distant of which was at a distance of 14 thousand kilometers! \n\nThe "Crystal Intercept" project was immediately classified as "Top Secret", however, before that moment, some devices made using such an amazing property still became public property. The "bioradar" device takes bearings on the radiation of living tissues of organisms, filtering them by frequency and distance. As a result, on a regular liquid crystal display, you can see marks indicating living organisms. \nThe disadvantages of the device include its high cost.</text>
