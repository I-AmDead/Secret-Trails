    <text>Barkeep: 'There all crazy to find out about the Wishmaster! All who could, immediately rushed to break through to the Zone center. Loners, Freedom, Duty, and even mercenaries. Whoever gets there first will pretty much on everthing; the Wishmaster, Klondike artifacts, and only the devil knows what else. Hurry the first one to the Sarcophagus will most likely get what they desire fulfilled. Right now there is a detachment of veteran in Pripyat that are going.

    <text>I disabled the 'Burner'. For some reason, for the time the burner was off I lost consciousness. And I had a dream: I was in Chernobyl at the Sarcophagus. Then there was a flash. Then a shining Monolith inside the Sarcophagus I saw. I understand that this is the Wishmaster. A stalker was there raging his hands were shaking. Then another bright flash, and again I see the excerpt from the first sleep. A man stands with his back to us and shoots. Suddenly he shouts and then freezes for a moment and then slowly begins to turn ... but then he fired in the opposite direction at a rat. I know one thing - I felt like I was really there. Now I must go to the Monolith.</text>
