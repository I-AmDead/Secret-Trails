    <text>In the cache I found a short report on how we, together with Fang, entered into the subterranean galleries around the Sarcophagus at Chernobyl, and found a suspicious door. Fang said that the next time we need to bring the decoder for the door's electronic lock. Then we were forced to flee. There are enemy patrols near the Monolith. Well I'm lucky the decoder was in the cache. And there is now a plan for how to find the door. In this case, as I understand, close to the deadly Monolith, enter the Sarcophagus over a destroyed reactor. And the Monolith might be in there somewhere.</text>
