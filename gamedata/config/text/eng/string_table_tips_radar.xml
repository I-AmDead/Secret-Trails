    <text>Strelok? Alive! That's good! You could still disable the 'Scorcher', all of our attempts to break through Pripyat to the Zone center have failed. What's there nobody knows, maybe artifacts of type Klondike, and possibly the 'Wishmaster'. Right now going to Pripyat is a force of veterans heading into the interior. If you hurry you'll be able to join them. I messaged them to wait a while.</text>
