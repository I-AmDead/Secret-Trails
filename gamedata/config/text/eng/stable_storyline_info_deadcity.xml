<string id="cit_doctor_meet_conclusion_txt">
	<text>I do not know what to say. Should I rejoice or grieve? I learned that I am Strelok. I apparently lost my memory while travelling through the Zone. I lost all of my friends except for the Doctor. I found out something that caused me to be followed. What did I find out? Next question... The Doctor managed to save the key and the location of the secret stash of our group at Pripyat. It's located in one of the rooms of the old hotel in Pripyat. He says that there must be something there that will shed some light on the ' Wish Granter' or 'Monolith'. I know one thing: after the second to last scouting expedition to Cherbobyl NPP, I kept on saying that there's something shady with 'Monolith'. Well 'Monolith', we're going to try and deal with you. Who are you and what are you?</text>

	<text>Doctor: 'When we last met you gave me the key for the secret stash in Pripyat, and the diagram which showed how to find it. I managed to save them. The Mercs didn't find them. Maybe there is something else there too. And also you kept on mumbling that there was something shady with 'Monolith'. That's for sure'.</text>

	<text>Doctor: 'The main mercenary forces are concentrated in the center of Pripyat. They are based there now. You might be able to open a transition to the north-east to Chernobyl or to the south-east to Freedom, or to the southern road in Amber.'</text>

	<text>Doctor: I know that many would be interested in a map of the city, especially 'Freedom' or 'Duty'. I overheard some guards talking about such a map, you should try to find it if you can.</text>

	<text>Mercenaries: \n Dushman founded this group after coming to the Zone to create an information line to the western intelligence agencies. It is through the mercenaries that they get their information. They also hired the mercenaries to establish a secret control over the Zone, by the means of elimination of certain individuals and territory seizure. In return they get money, supplies and weaponry. Entry into the group is closed to the general stalker population, new mercenaries are trained in western paramilitary organizations before being sent to the Zone.</text>

	<text>Vasily Petrovich's Log \n\n 19:00 \n Vasily Petrovich: 'for some reason, wants to go to Dead City to look for someone. Simple job, easy money. We're leaving in an hour. \n\n 20:06 \n Entered the area five minutes ago with an Ak74/2U and some magazines. \n\n 20:28 \n We're going to bybass the mercs and bandits by going north-west around them. \n\n 21:08\n Damn! We ran into an ambush, they snagged Doctor. I managed to get away... looks like they were after Doctor... they didn't chase me. I can't pursue them... got a bullet wound in the leg... feels stiff even though I patched it up. I'm going to rest and then figure out how to get out of here safely. I can't take the road to Army Warehouses... fucking checkpoint. My best bet is going through 'Forest'. It's my only chance.'</text>
