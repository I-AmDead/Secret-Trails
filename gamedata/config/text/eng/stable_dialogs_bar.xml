    <text>So this is your first fight? Your opponent is a piece of meat just like you. He's here because of debts and he only has two options: to come out and fight or to land himself in the nearest anomaly. He's gonna fight like a cornered animal. So what equipment should I get you to use for today? Let me think. Why don't you two use PMM's. Two mags each should be plenty. Either you kick his ass or we feed you to the dogs. Not much of a choice. Go on now.</text>

<string id="bar_arena_man_job_12">
    <text>Your last fight didn't mean shit dude. You're still the same piece of meat you were before and no self respecting person will bet a single ruble on you. If you wanna earn some proper cash you're gonna have to make a few more appearances in the arena. Your new opponent also got through the first round and his fight was a lot harder than yours. I don't like him, to be honest, he kills too quickly, and the crowd doesn't like that. So go and show us what you can do! The stakes will increase after this fight. All you gotta do is stay alive. Move it!</text>

<string id="bar_arena_man_job_13">
    <text>Well well, you're not as much of a wuss as you first seemed. Now it's time to test you out in a real fight. You're up against two guys. The first one's called Swede and I don't remember the second one's name. They were paired up intentionally as they hate each other's guts so don't worry about them working as a team. They're more likely to shoot each other. Today is rifle day so don't let them get too close or we'll have to pick you up piece by piece. The odds are 10:1. If you win you'll make a fair amount. Off you go!</text>

<string id="bar_arena_man_job_131">

<string id="bar_arena_man_job_14">
    <text>Well, now I can safely say that you're a fighter, a real fighter. Now it's time for a team fight. You get to fight with two rookies, two brothers, on your side. They haven't fought yet but they're brothers so I had to put them into a team fight. I wouldn't expect any real help from them if I were you. You're fighting an experienced team. They're contenders for the Final this season. A dangerous lot. They use different weapons but one has an automatic shotgun so be very careful with him. Good luck pal, you're gonna need it.</text>

<string id="bar_arena_man_job_15">
    <text>You've got a special fight today. Even the army has heard about you! Don't be surprised, they fight here too. There's even a general in the crowd. These guys are from Spetsnaz or from the riot police. They're well armed and their armor is good as you'd expect. Don't worry though I ain't gonna leave you out in the rain either. You'll get a vest used by Freedom. It's light so it won't slow you down. Go on, show them that stalkers ain't no whipping boys. Good luck!</text>

<string id="bar_arena_man_job_151">

    <text>Wait, I'm not ready.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_job_16">
    <text>Time for you to show what you can do. 'Duty' captured a group of bandits that had been causing problems for stalkers near Rostok. Duty took 'em at night, so most of the bandits were taken alive. They were all gonna be executed anyway so I convinced Duty to give them a chance. If any of them survive they'll go in the dumpster outside the Zone, which is better than dying here. They're not well armed, just a few pistols and shotguns. But there's six of them so watch yourself. Go on now!</text>

<string id="bar_arena_man_job_17">
    <text>Well you're almost in the final. Now you'll be fighting a real stalker. He's alone but he's got an FN2000 and he's inside an exoskeleton. Catch one burst and you're toast. There will be a surprise that I can't tell you about too. Here's my advice: be prepared, it's gonna be tough. The winner makes it through to the final. Fight to the death, now go!</text>

    <text>Congratulations, you're in the final! One more to go and this one is to the death, every man for himself. There will be 4 other stalkers in the arena. All real pros in exoskeletons with HK G36's. It's a fair deal this time because you'll get exactly what they have. The only thing is you don't get medkits or bandages in a fight to the death. Ready? Go prove you're the best, Go go to!</text>

    <text>I've got a serious mission. A group of veteran killers has showed up in Wild Territory again. Some Duty people came to me and asked me to deal with these veterans. Duty has solid proof that they are responsible for the deaths of some solo stalkers. The problem is that these veterans and Duty have some old peace agreement and Duty can't break it but these guys are really pushing it. Basically Duty wants them taken out nice and quiet. It ain't gonna be easy, but the job is worth a lot of rubles.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_jobs_23111">
    <text>Anything else? Seems strange that Duty is letting them get away with it.</text>

    <text>There is a serious matter. In Wild Territory once again appeared a group of veteran killers. Some guys came to me from 'Duty' and asked me to have someone deal with these veterans. 'Duty' has irrefutable evidence of involvement of veterans in the murders of individuals. The point here is that they have a an old aggreement that 'Duty' cannot break In short 'Duty' wants them to be quietly removed. Specifying a complex but well-paid task.</text>

    <text>Yeah, here.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1212">

</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_12121">
    <text>Damn it! Here I am, busting my arse while you're off wandering in the woods! Go get those damn documents or we won't make any progress!</text>

<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_121211">
    <text>Okay already!</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_131">
    <text>Well Strelok now we just need to deal with the Scorcher and open the way North! You ready to go now?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1312">
    <text>Yes.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_13121">
    <text>Ok Strelok you’ve got the protective prototype so you’ll be safe from the emissions. I have the bunker coordinates. Don’t forget that the prototype won’t protect you forever, so you need to get to the bunker ASAP and turn off the Scorcher. I don’t know what will happen after that, but I am sure it will be worth it. The only thing we can be sure of is that the road to the Zone’s center will be open.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1313">
    <text>Go on.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1314">
    <text>All we need to do is get to the antennas and disable them. Got it?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1315">
    <text>Got it.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1316">
    <text>Oh yeah, one last thing! The leader of Duty, I marked him on the map, needs a volunteer to carry out some sort of assignment at the military warehouses. If you're interested you can drop by. I'll talk with the guards, they'll let you in.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_132">
    <text>No, I'm not ready yet.</text>

    <text>Get ready, Strelok! This task can't wait!</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_151">
    <text>OK, the documents you brought from the Institute make some things a little clearer but we’re still missing the info we need to get a full picture. A lab designated X-18 is mentioned and its description matches the abandoned underground vaults in Dark Valley. Looks like you’ll have to go there and get the info we need. The lab is closed and you’ll need two electronic keys to get inside. I’ll give you one but you’ll have to get the other one from Borov in Dark Valley.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1511">
    <text>Go on.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_15111">
    <text>All you have to do is acquire the second key to Lab X-18, then get inside and retrieve the second batch of documents. Don’t forget to get yourself a protective suit or you won’t have a chance in hell of getting to the lab. So will you do it?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_15112">
    <text>I'll try.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_15113">
    <text>Great! I'll be waiting.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_15114">
    <text>No, I don't want to do it yet.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_15115">
    <text>Up to you but remember: this is the only way that can help us open the road to the North.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_161">
    <text>What do you want, Strelok?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_162">
    <text>Hey Strelok! Times change. You seem grumpy and aloof. Here, take a seat, have a drink, might calm you down.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_171">
    <text>So, Strelok, you brought the documents from X18?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_172">
    <text>Yep. Here.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1721">
    <text>Good, the situation has becoming clearer. As I expected this Brain Scorcher is man-made. It’s a Kaymanov experimental emitter and its components were made exactly in X-18. These documents refer to lab X-16 where they sent some components. According to this X-16 is located in the production complex area by the lake in Yantar. The scientists have set up a mobile lab around there so maybe they can help.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_17211">
    <text>Go on.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_17212">
    <text>It ain’t simple. You need to get to the scientists and find out where X-16 is so you can get the missing documents. So are you up for it?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_17213">
    <text>Yeah.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_172131">
    <text>Great! I'll be waiting.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_17214">
    <text>No, I'm not ready yet.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_172141">
    <text>Well get ready real quick Strelok! This sort of business can't wait.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_173">
    <text>No.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1731">
    <text>What are you wasting time for? Go get those damn documents or we won't make any progress!</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_181">
    <text>What do you want, Strelok?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_182">
    <text>Hello Strelok. You seem unsociable. Sit down and have drink and relax bit.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_2">
    <text>Hey, Strelok! Have you brought the documents from the Institute?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_21">

    <text>That ain't good, Strelok, ain't good at all. You understand how much we need 'em, don'tcha? We need 'em bad, believe me. The Brain Scorcher is right under our noses but we don't even know what it is! Go get the documents right now - we'll talk after that.</text>

    <text>Great work, Strelok! We have the documents at last. I need to have a look at them now and maybe I’ll work out how to get North. While I do that, if you have problems with money, you can fight at the Arena. The owner of the Arena is Arnie. I've uploaded his coordinates.</text>

    <text>What do you know about Strelok?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_31">
    <text>An experienced stalker as far as I know. He used to work around the northern exits from the Zone. He was hardly ever seen here, but there are rumours that he took his group right into the center of the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_4">
    <text>What do you know about a stalker they call Ghost?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_41">
    <text>He's one of Strelok's men. They say he can sneak in anywhere without being noticed. I heard that he took out the leader of some crazy group. What was the name? Ah, 'Final Day', that's the one. They were pretty wild those boys. Oh, by the way, I heard that Ghost is doing some job for the scientists so if you're looking for him try Yantar at the mobile lab.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_51">
    <text>He's an old stalker in retirement. He lives in the marshes. I'll mark him on the map for you. He used to be in Strelok's group back in the day.</text>

<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_6">
    <text>What do you know about a stalker called Fang?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_61">
    <text>There was a man that went by that name, spoke with a lisp. He was a bit weird that's for sure. Talked to himself and stuff. But he seemed like an okay guy. I haven't seen him around for ages.</text>

<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_7">
    <text>Tell me about the mobile science labs.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_71">
    <text>Scientists set them up from time to time. Isolated metal bunkers with everything you need to live. We're in contact with one of these labs in Yantar. Scientists are good guys. They tell us a lot of interesting things and we help them out when we can. An exchange of sorts.</text>

    <text>What is the wish granter?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_81">
    <text>Oh! That's an interesting question. I wish I knew the answer. I can tell you the legend about the Granter if you want but you make up your own mind how much truth there's in it. Wanna hear it?</text>

<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811">
    <text>Well, that's very interesting.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_8111">
    <text>This legend is about the Monolith which may be what caused the Zone to appear. When the Zone exploded in 2006, they evacuated people living near it and the Zone itself was fenced off by the Army. Everyone was panicking, nobody knew what was going on, the Zone was expanding and the field labs couldn't do anything! Loads of people died there. Everyone was afraid of the radiation which could affect half of Europe. After a few years had passed some reckless guys like you appeared. They called themselves stalkers. They started to sneak past army guards believing that there are things in the Zone that would make them rich. Bit by bit, they brought out weird things like artifacts. The competition became fierce. Scientists went after them like crazy. They paid fantastic money for just one trinket back then, not like now.</text>

    <text>Go on...</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811111">
    <text>After a while, the first tales and legends about what's deep inside the Zone by the nuclear power plant started to circulate. It was also then that one of the veterans told us the story of a Monolith that allegedly grants your wishes. You should have seen the hysteria, experienced level-headed men started trying to break through to the center. Everyone wanted something from the Monolith. We got some morbid details about the first stalker who made it through to the Monolith.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_8111111">
    <text>Go on... tell me more.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_81111111">
    <text>When the Zone had just appeared many people were trapped inside and cut off from the outside world. Most of them died pretty quickly but there were a few lucky survivors who tried to do something about it. One of these survivors found himself by the station and noticed some strange light inside. With no way back he decided to try to get closer. He saw the broken roof of the Sarcophagus and the light coming out through it. He climbed up the wall and looked inside. Among the debris of metal and molten concrete there lay a massive black rock. It was the Monolith. The stalker managed to shake off the "spell" and realised that he had climbed very close to the Sarcophagus, which was highly radioactive. He was scared to death but through the fear he could sense the Monolith calling to him. The Monolith called to him and he came to see strange, unbelievable things about the Monolith inside his head...</text>

    <text>I don't know what's true in this story and what's not but the point is the guy made a wish which came true and the Zone grew by another 5 kilometers. It seems the Zone gobbles up more land for every wish that is granted. But that ain't gonna stop hotshots like you. They keep trying to break through with their precious little wishes in their hearts.</text>

    <text>Here's what I got to say. You helped Freedom and made the right choice. Your fate is now tied with that of Freedom and Duty has you in its sights.

    <text>Hello Strelok. You helped Freedom and made the right choice. Your fate is now tied with that of Freedom and Duty has you in its sights. I'd suggest you go to the abandoned military base and join Freedom because they need good fighters.</text>

<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_start_211">
    <text>I'll think about it.</text>

    <text>So you're connected with Freedom then?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_1">
    <text>I can't answer that question right now. All I can say is that I am not a member of any group.</text>

    <text>Tell me about the Freedom faction.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_1">
    <text>Sure, no problem! Freedom is one of the oldest groups in the Zone and the only one that openly opposes government troops and research teams. Its founders are dead, they were killed during a big bloodbath after the army dropped a large assault force in the Zone. But the ability to control the Zone from outside was destroyed at the same time. There is some evidence to suggest that originally the Zone was used as a secret army weapon's testing site. If that's true then they must have used some powerful shit. Anyway, what was I saying...? Oh yeah, Freedom is the only group that is trying to stop the government from gaining control over the testing site again. God knows what will happen if they start testing their shit again. So Freedom is trying to hold out at all costs.</text>

<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_2">
    <text>What about Duty?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_3">
    <text>Duty is basically controlled from the outside by the government. Their current objective is to clear the territory of mutants and destroy Freedom, which is what they are doing at the moment. When the time is right they will drop a large assault force in the Zone and take control of the area.</text>

    <text>The secret of Lake Yantar is similar to the secret of the Brain Scorcher and their effects are similar in many ways. Some kind of emission zombifies all who come in contact with it.

<string id="bar_bar_visitors_10_start_7111">
    <text>Useful to a rookie? Well, listen up. To the North, not far from the Brain Scorcher, Freedom have set up their HQ in an old military base. They're notorious nihilists, anarchists and criminals, freedom fighters, freaking guerrillas all of them. All they do is sabotage research groups, attack army units and constantly skirmish with Duty. These skirmishes are now spilling over into a small scale war for survival. Let me give you some advice, never get involved with them. They'll only accept you if you're totally crazy and there's a reward on your head. Ha-ha-ha. Can you believe that?</text>

    <text>Can you tell me anything that would be useful to a rookie?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_12_start_7111">
    <text>Well, there used to be this group led by Strelok. There were all sorts of legends about it going around the Zone, good and bad. Few people really knew the truth. The truth is that they wanted to deal with the Zone, find out what created it. That's why military stalkers were after them but they didn't know where to look. The government didn't want normal stalkers to know things they shouldn't have known. One day Strelok found something really important and made a move towards the center of the Zone with some of his boys. Half of the group died on the way but the rest made it through. What happened to them there no one knows. Looks like they've copped it. The other group members were caught and killed. I don't think there are any of them left now. Sad story, eh?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_12_start_71111">

    <text>Mercs are kinda like Freedom, only worse. At least Freedom have some ideals, but these scumbags will do anything for money. Someone really needs to eliminate them before they take something really dangerous out of the Zone into the normal world! They're based in Dead City.

    <text>C'mon, chill man. Tell me what happened.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_start_89">
    <text>The three of us were getting ready to try to get through to the North. We didn't know when the Scorcher emissions were to happen, but Pocky managed to get some info. I don't know where. We were half-way through the sector when the Scorcher suddenly switched on again. Pocky passed out straight away and fell down a hillside. I panicked and said that we should leave everything and go back. Hunchback managed to pull himself together and said that we had to get Pocky out. I said 'You're an idiot, don't you wanna live? It's over for him, how are we gonna carry him all the way back?' Just as he managed to convince me and started to climb down to get Pocky another wave came. By the time I came to my senses I was by the military base. I thought Hunchback and Pocky stayed there, but Hunchback got him out but didn't make it himself.</text>

<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_start_90">
    <text>OK, Baldy, OK. Calm down, man. Thanks for telling me what happened. I'll talk to Pocky myself.</text>

    <text>There this guy that had a lisp and walked with a stoop so he got the name Hunchback. He was a bit mashugana. Talked to himself and to animals. But apart from that he was an ok guy. He disappeared a long time ago in the center with Strelok. They say Strelok is now back.</text>

    <text>The Wild Territory is infested with bloodsuckers now! They come out at night. I heard there's something really important at the factory that's nearby, something essential to someone.

    <text>If you go around Lake Yantar you'll come to the scientists' camp. They're doing research of some sort there. They were dropped in by helicopter and they also get regular supply drops. They've got a nice safe place there. You can deal with them too, they buy artifacts and might even give you some tasks.</text>

    <text>Nobody has managed to get through the vehicle scrapyard because of the Brain Scorcher. Some people did see a stalker go through the invisible border, fall over, then get up in a couple of minutes and head straight for the center of the scrapyards. He ain't been seen since.</text>

    <text>Missing stalkers come back from time to time. It's a scary sight I tell you. They mumble a lot and reach for missing weapons. One came to a Duty outpost some time ago and a crowd gathered to look at him. Someone even recognized him. He was scary, red eyes, all bloodshot and bruised, couldn't say a word, just moaned like an animal and went around in circles. Duty took him in, but he died after a couple of days anyway.

    <text>There are a lot of zombies around Lake Yantar. They wander around and attack any human they see. If you're spotted you might wanna run for your life. There are too many former stalkers around there. They died at the lake and that's all that's left of them.</text>

<string id="bar_bar_visitors_8_start_7111">
    <text>Traders say that there's a real treasure trove of artifacts in the center of the Zone, so anyone who makes it through will make enough money for two lifetimes. Personally I think there's more to this. Obviously the traders think about their own interests, but there are strange rumours going around. Apparently there's something better than artifacts there, something that ain't from this world, something alien or from another dimension altogether! They call it the 'Wish Granting'. I heard a legend about a stalker who made it through. Only every time someone makes a wish the Zone grows and nobody who gets there uses his wish to make it disappear. I guess when you get to that thing you don't give a shit about anyone else.</text>

    <text>Everyone who believes in the Monolith is completely nuts. They keep banging on about it but nobody actually knows what's in the center of the Zone. An invisible crystal that fell from the skies ... ha-ha-ha! I reckon one of the secret labs blew up. I mean some stalkers used to work in a few of them. But obviously you can't bomb the Zone. Not only will the radiation spread all over the world, half of Europe would be flattened by the Zone's reaction. Someone has gone totally mad lately and I heard they're killing normal stalkers for no reason at all. How do you like that? Damn fanatics.</text>

    <text>That's a good question Strelok and there's an equally good answer to it. Kill Freedom anarchists. You'll get a reward for every PDA of theirs you bring and you might get promoted too. Take all the PDAs you get to Colonel Petrenko, he gives out the rewards.</text>

<string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_1">
    <text>I want to ask you to do one thing personally for me. You see we're in the midst of territorial warefare with the Freedom faction and we need some weapons more powerful than what we have. Freedom has some excellent Bulldog 6 granade launchers. If you could penetrate their territory and steal at least one such granade launcher I would generously reward you. Since you aren't in our faction you can quickly gain the trust of Freedom. If you're lucky get a hold of the Bulldog 6.</text>

    <text>Go on!</text>

    <text>I'll upload the location of the Freedom base for you. You'll need to find the chef, Cook. He's a member of Freedom. He knows where the RG-6 is kept. And he likes his booze so bring a lot of vodka with you. So, what do you say?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_1111">
    <text>Ok, I'll try to steal a Bulldog 6 from Freedom.</text>

    <text>Oh, and one more thing. Colonel Skull and his boys disobeyed my order and decided to attack the Freedom base without authorization. Well, they can reap what they sow... suicidal bastards. Don't get involved in their fight. Just try to get me the Bulldog 6. Nothing else matters.</text>

    <text>We've been here since the beginning. The first group was made up of the surviving members of special units sent into the Zone to find out what caused it to appear.

    <text>Before the accident in '86 this was an industrial area. As you can see there ain't much left of it now. In the basement by the hangar you'll find '100 Rads Bar'. The place is run by the local trader who doubles up as a barman. If you want to trade, talk, get a mission, or find out the latest news, that's the place to go. There's also the Arena where you can fight and make some cash. Duty's base is not far from the Arena. If you want to join Duty go straight over there, they'll tell you who to speak to. Oh, by the way, all of this area is protected by Duty so behave and keep your weapons holstered. If you start shooting the patrol will calm you down real quick.</text>

    <text>I'd like to know something.</text>

    <text>What is it that you want to know?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_11">
    <text>Who are you and how did you end up here?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_111">
    <text>My name is Kruglov. I am a professor of biology. I study the Zone. Yesterday, for example, I found an animal of particular interest - Antropomorphus Dendromutantus Vulgaris. I mostly find and document new species of mutant animals, their traits and distinctive features. The information is then thoroughly studied and transferred to the outside world. Some of it, of course, goes to the Barkeep. My discoveries have helped to save the lives of many stalkers. I was just transporting the results of my latest research to the laboratory near Lake Yantar when the helicopter came under fire.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12">
    <text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_121">
    <text>The Zone is a wonderful gift to humanity. Of course normal existence here is not possible due to the high radiation levels and aggressive mutants. All of these things are obviously extremely dangerous but they are also things of great scientific value. The Zone is almost a natural experiment, a treasure for scientists! The extent to which humanity's knowledge could be increased through the study of the Zone is unfathomable. Technology, medicine, new plants (medical and edible), biotechnology, cures for incurable diseases... anything! Perhaps we can solve the food problem for the entire planet. If people didn't interfere science could lead humanity into a new golden era!</text>

<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_1211">
    <text>Duty thinks otherwise and even Freedom doesn't seem to want to help you.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12111">
    <text>You're simply incapable of grasping the whole picture. Your current problems are far more important to you than the future of humanity!</text>

<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_1212">
    <text>Maybe there is some use in studying the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12121">
    <text>So you understand that too? It's wonderful to discover that there are those among you who are not narrow-minded practical people. I've always said it's important to look at the whole set of issues from a broader perspective, to distance ourselves from the simple human measures. Even if the Zone has done harm to humanity, it can still be of great use to us!</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_13">
    <text>Why are Mercs looking for this information?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_131">
    <text>I hope this doesn't offend you, but many stalkers are not to bright. They are seriously affected by things they find out. Just think of all these legends about a Monolith that grants wishes. What a joke! The problem is that these guys play their games with real weapons and cause death. Childish people are often annoyed about the fact that someone doesn't share everything with them, including information that is not meant for them. There are no limits in the use of force. They shoot without thinking and kill those who study the Zone. They believe that this information will allow them to open the way to the center of the Zone. They're fools, dangerous and naive fools!</text>

    <text>So please tell me.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_3">
    <text>Not long ago I went on a task and found a guy. He was very dirty, leaves, mud and slush all over him, and he was wearing an old jacket which he used as an old antiradiation suit. I got close to him and saw that he wasn't wounded, his look was mad, his eyes were glazed. I ask him why he's here and what happened. He implores me to give him some food and drink. 'Comply and respect the experienced', he was saying. I gave him water and bread with sausage, kindled a fire, warmed up two cans of tinned stew. I knew that our discussion would be a long one. I did't hurry so I agreed to listen to his story. His name was Efim and he was 43 years old. He came to the Zone in the beginning. He traveled everywhere, and found lots of unique artifacts. Well that is tipical for early stakers, but one day he decided to go beyond Radar to Pripyat.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_4">
    <text>So what then? Really?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_5">
    <text>He said it was no longer possible to go through the tunnel, which ran lines of communication between the Radar and Pripyat because an emission caused to much damage. At first I suspected that he was lying, but his story became convincing because of all the strange things he described. The tunnel ended close to one of the supply stations in Pripyat. He wandered into a hangar, a large room in which there was spoiled food, rotted clothing, rusty ammunition, etc. When leaving the hangar he nearly walked into an anomaly. The anomaly he said looked like, 'there were silver threads in its center looking like a cobweb, which was covered with small bubbles like dew, and behind this cobweb was darkness. He was frightened by it. He decided to throw a bolt into the anomaly. At first bolt flew normally, but after that... well</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_6">
    <text>What happened then?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_7">
    <text>The bolt twisted up and then was blown into many pieces. He continued on and avoided other strange anomalies always throwing bolts in front of him. There was a house with poltergeists in it and he killed them all with a grenade. Then he spent the night there. In the morning he continued his travel and finally reached the city of Pripyat. He saw a statue of Lenin in a large courtyard. The statue looked all rusty with moss all over it. He threw a bolt at it and the bolt turned into rusty dust and fell to the ground. It was dawn there in Pripyat when this happened.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_8">
    <text>This story is very interesting! And so?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_9">
    <text>In the strange muddy sky the sun ascended not knowing that on Earth there was such a vile place called the 'Zone'. Having passed an entrance in Chernobyl NPP Efim and his guide saw the 'Sarcophagus'. The building looked surreal against the sky. There was a strange dim light behind it. And then the sky turned gray, more and even more in the background. Some black dots flashed before their eyes. The whole world became two colors, black and grey. The Geiger counter showed radiation activity, then there was an emission. New anomalies, Acid, Gravi, Electra had appeared. The guide fled, his legs carried him further from this terrible place, and in his head were voices, many voices.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_10">
    <text>So what happened to him?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_11">
    <text>It seemed that the guide had his brains affected by an electric field. Supposedly the guy yelled about hearing voices. The guy walked into some kind of anomaly portal, and was transferred to somewhere in Radar. I have thought about this and realized that yesterday there was an emission, not especially a strong one. The facts do not lie. The guide choked on his own blood. He had a strange skin color, lilac. I say to the Zone, 'what are you, who are you?'.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_12">
    <text>Has he died?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_13">
    <text>Yes, he ended up turning into ugly jelly. A terrible sight, something you don't want to see unless you like the looks of peanut butter, nuts and lime jelly mixed together.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_14">
    <text>All right, thanks. It'll be good for you to write memoirs about the Zone.</text>
</string>

<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story_0">
    <text>I can see you are a man with skills? You surely have seen a lot of action.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story_1">
    <text>Yeah, I have been around. I partnered with SRI guys to travel to a painfully lonely place. No animals or mutants.  They had decided to quietly explore that place. We left after dark, and by the time we got there it was dawn. We left the car in the street and went to the forest edge. We stopped and stayed at the bottom of a large tree. I climbed up the tree with optics and looked around. I could see a body, and it did not appear to be very old. There was grass everywhere. I didn't notice any activity. Then suddenly I heard someone with an automatic shooting. I pointed my optics in the direction of the sound and I noticed by a building a man being hunted by rat. He was shooting indiscriminately in all directions. He did not look familar to me. He was there alone as far as I could tell. And then I saw clearly his weapons flew out of his hands and then he flew up into the air. As if he had grown wings.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story_2">
    <text>It is hard to believe!</text>

    <text>Do not doubt...</text>

    <text>I wonder what the hell killed the man? I see you have traveled the Zone, kilometer after kilometer. You must have seen many strange things.</text>

<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_0">
    <text>Hello Sergeant, how's it going?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_1">
    <text>Lousy, every day either an ambush or mutants. We came here recently with our commander. We notices some bandits so we went into a hangar to hide. We hoped there were not any monster in there. The place was dusty and full of cobwebs. Our detectors didn't show anything. A couple guys where positioned as lookouts. Sanya was ahead of me looking for cover. Then suddenly a rusty ceiling beam came crashing down. How Sanya got out of the way we'll never understand. And the beam landed exactly where he was standing. Well he must have ducked and rolled somehow to avoid being crushed. The noise frightened some of the guys and they started shooting everywhere. Then Sanya shouts about a creature in a corner. I looked and didn't see anything. We were lucky not to have killed ourselves by accident.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_2">
    <text>Continue.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_3">
    <text>We are not in here more than five minutes and all hell hell breaks lose. Guys wasting half a mag of ammo shooting all over the place. And suddenly one of the guys falls into a hole in the floor, and a second guy has a door fall on him. If there is a creature here it must be having a good time! Then one of the guys throws a gas grenade into one of the corners. Out comes a flying creature and I almost crapped my pants. I wondered if this creature had loosened the beam. This reptile injured four guys.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_4">
    <text>Bullshit! Really?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_5">
    <text>Sanya had heard rustling in that corner and throwing the granade was by reflex. Well the creature did squeal! We too were squealing and jumping all over the place. The creature flew above us and made a strange cry that hurt our ears. Well finally the creature is killed and it looked like a soul was released. Then Sanya takes out his knife and starts stabbing the creature's body that was now on the floor. The Commander calmly says 'let's get the hell out of here'.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_drunk_dolg_story_0">
    <text>Why are you sad stalker?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_drunk_dolg_story_1">
    <text>I have lost a friend, a good friend, Sanya! Hmm... well, we had gathered together the day before yesterday for a campaign to go with my friends Sanya and Roma. We where out of money so we took the task from the Barkeep to get some bloodsucker jaws. The scientists wanted some. We went to an abandoned village near the Army Warehouses that is west of the road. Ever been there? I had with me a SPAS-12, Sanya had a ÀÊ-74, and Roma an Abakan. We were standing on a hill facing the village with our backs to the road. Lot of radiation there. We stood there in silence. We could hear some sounds. It was very dark then. There are more bloodsuckers out at night according to the Barkeep. We could just barely see some small houses. It's not a good time to hunt bloodsuckers when it's dark. We locked and loaded our weapons, fastened small lamps to our helmets, and quietly moved forward.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_drunk_dolg_story_2">
    <text>Well?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_drunk_dolg_story_3">
    <text>So we are moving along and Sanya steps on a bone. The clown! I can still hear that crunch in my head. I think it was a pig bone. We stand as statues now, our lanterns shining and looking like ballerinas in a pose. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Then Sanya was attacked by a bloodsucker, then Roma, them me, and I was knocked down. Sanya was attacked from behind and he was bittened in the head. The bloodsucker was sucking out Sanya's brain. I vommited some canned food I had eaten earlier. Well Roma was tough enough to kill the bloodsuckers that attacked he and I. Roma then helped me up. We could hear more bloodsuckers coming so we ran like hell, and ran all the way to the Bar. For a century I will be grateful to Roma. And it is a pity about Sanya. Let's drink to our departed good friend Sanya!</text>

<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story_0">
    <text>So how's life?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story_1">
    <text>With a friend I recently went to the border of the Zone. I took my Druganov. Business as usual. We approach a wire fence. I take out the wire cutters and head to the wire fence. There Vasil looks at me that way he usually does with at strange look and says 'I bet I'll pass through with seven actions?', so I say 'I'll do it in six actions!', 'And he says five!', 'I say four!', 'he says three!', 'I say two!', 'he says ONE!'. Wow, so I think for second how he's going to pull this off? So I say ok wise ass do it! And this tard pulls out a grenade and threw it under the fence!</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story_2">
    <text>Is that the truth?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story_3">
    <text>Well needless to say, I yelled 'NADE!!'. and we both dove into a ditch. I hit the ground to hard I almost broke my nose. I said 'was that really necessary, Fedyan?'. Then boooom!!! And we were covered in dirt. And then I noticed a sign on a fence post above my head that said 'Do not approach! DANGER!'. I thought to me self, 'yeah ah-huh'. So we get up and go through the fence into a field through a grove and ten minutes later we hear machine guns firing into some of the trees around us. There must have been an outpost nearby. Here I say to Vasil humerously, 'before we die I will kill you first'. So we get up and continue running through a forest.</text>

<string id="bar_arena_man_story_1">
    <text>Tonight heard some history that seemed improbable about a skilled stalker named Gray. Who he is and where he is from is not know. Gray was supposedly one of the very first to come here. Seems as though he was always here. I'm always amazed at how some stalker travel the Zone and find artifacts and never seem to get injured. A mystery. But seems true. I overheard this conversation and had initially dismissed it as nonsense. The usual drunk delirium. But the stalker spoke with such surprising clarity that I had soon started to believe him.</text>

<!-- needs work from here down -->
<string id="bar_arena_man_story_3">
    <text>'... Means. Pushed I a door - have again opened. I walk. It is Again closed. I, mean, her, the stinker I open, and it, the stinker, itself is closed! I, øî at a door have understood me someone not come off. Well well, has got into a window. Inside took a breath, has recovered hardly, has gone to look, who with a door indulged it. And there the room greater, in it a table stands, long such, as highway. And at a table the chair stands, high such, as a television tower. And here someone has whispered at me in a head, already the echo has gone! ' You who? ' - asks, I speak: ' Gray I, casual, here each the dog knows me '. Here has again whispered: ' You, Gray, what for on a Zone understands, what for in a window have climbed? '. And I have not become puzzled, I speak: ' So it, has come water to have a drink, I look - anybody is not present, here and has climbed '. ' ah water... Is not present Gray, you here water. And it is not necessary to you more '. ' Is not present water? Well, than I have gone? " . Òóòà I have tried to chop off from there on fast. Here all one, or the creature what here with me has started talking, or the delirium tremens, and is time to take up from the Zone. ' You ïîãîäè, Gray, remain, business to you is ' - has again whispered, and foots to a floor clinged, to not move. ' Something with yours head not so, I almost do not feel you ". ' that it, I ask, me it is necessary feel, it is not necessary me feel '. ' That and it, that is necessary ' - øîïîò speaks. ' I such as you, for two hundred meters I feel, and you here only before the door, and that, only after you to break the beginnings. At you that, the new special equipment what is? '.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_story_4">
    <text>And Gray?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_story_5">
    <text>What equipment? Not much. A small lamp here, and an old double-barrelled shotgun. At me, the citizen the chief, anything such was not available '. ' you do not say lies to me, Gray, I through see you, do not lead up to a sin '. ' yes really, no! Well though search! '. ' And here it is possible ' - has whispered again. Here at me the padded jacket has begun to move, everything, that in pockets was, to creep out the beginning in itself. And the main thing, cup treasured, there! Well, I think, reptiles, native to you I shall not give! Up to a hut all the day to stamp, I shall not live! I have seized a bottle, as in kid: ' My it kindly, the citizen the chief! ' And a bottle as who holds! Also does not give, pulls upwards. Well, I think, bullshits, not to you to moonshine! Has tightened a bottle to itself, teeth a fuse has taken out, has started to drink. Three drinks has hardly made.</text>

    <text>Not to bad. By the way Strelok, have you heard of a new monster?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_2">
    <text>No.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_3">
    <text>Okay, that's what my friend has told me. Has lifted him in the middle of night the heads - run in laboratory, the cargo has come. he slept, is not cut: what cargo? They to him: ' Have you drunk too much?' He went to a table. And there such... He, on a course, corpses from the Zone on the century has seen: torn, fried, boiled, and mutants one ten has got to you not, and here at once in a stomach the supper to walk the beginnings. More shortly, from the first sight, without two minutes the person, only a head on normal the fig is not similar: healthy such pumpkin mounded. Well and a body, a concentration camp, a pancake, a leather yes bones. But he has then disassembled it, and all over again, speaks, I look, medley any: all ripped an orange-red dirty trick, blood of type... Those dumbasses wasted so much ammo.  And in general they it is obvious on him in jackboots the have well taken a walk; not object, and a piece of meat in black rags.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_4">
    <text>M-yes... Not a pleasant sight.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_5">
    <text>It is shorter, He all rest of night and half of morning lagged. On a course, it turns out, she is that creature whom local for the illusionist know: black cloths, visions at stalkers, head meter in a grasp... Nice that at him for the face who saw, considered are a type îcciput. Not, the person at it naturally is, only fine absolutely: eyes do not open also a nose as a pin though a mouth - huge, the jamb at a gate is direct. Goes, it is visible, and a head on a breast lowers - forces are not present exactly to hold... Brainer... And estimate, that these creatures for a dinner eat. Fungi! Fungi! More shortly, all saw - in the Zone of mushrooms full so ' old men ' give a tooth, that these creatures from them press juice. Gourmets, a pancake... And still you know, that at him in ìåøî÷êå it has been on one side secreted? Well? Yes where to you! More shortly, brains were there at it dried. And you know, whose? Controller's!..</text>

<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_6">
    <text>Hmm...</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_0">
    <text>What's wrong? You look at though you just came from a funeral.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_1">
    <text>Yes, I fell in love, like a damn schoolboy. I've met a girl, you won't believe me. Have you seen any women in the Zone? But this was... she... perfection. Yes, perfection. I had a sensation that the world around of her was black-and-white and washed away, and she all in color and sharpnesses as she moved! I have never seen here before. I've already got lump in my throat. What was she doing here in the Zone? By evening business was closed. At the road service station there was a nine story building. First something in a window on a ground floor flashed. I turned my safety off on my kalash, and rubbed my eyes. You never know what to expect from the Zone? And there she sits. And I stand like a fool with my weapon out. Then I said something stupid... a habit already.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_2">
    <text>I hear ya, we are losing it here in the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_3">
    <text>Then she noticed me... smiled... greets me. I couldn't hear what she was saying, I was just starring at her. She was in a dark outfit, and it fit her just right. Her body was fantastic! She was talking, but I wasn't listening, just standing and smiling, like an idiot. I think she was from a research group. I asked whether I could help her. I would jump into an anomaly if she asked me too. She says 'yep'. Has told, that she is engaged in these, as them... Endemices Zones. Well, plants which only here meet. She said that she is in research and deals with these Endemic areas. You know, plants that are found only around here. She said that she escaped from the research guards, because with them there is no freedom of thought, and came here alone. Who knows? I guess I believe her. I agreed to help her find something. After two days she left with here possessions.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_4">
    <text>And have you seen her since?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_5">
    <text>No. It's been two months now. I hate to think that something happened to her.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_6">
    <text>I know how you feel. It's another story like Romeo and Juliet. Don't be to sad, it will be forgotten.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_7">
    <text>I don't think that I will ever forget her. Not those eyes.</text>
</string>

<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_0">
    <text>Greetings, it is possible to chat with you for a bit?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_1">
    <text>Well, I'm not much for chating. Is there something I can do for you?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_2">
    <text>Where can I get some really good weapons and ammo?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_22">
    <text>I understand, most stalker have some variation of AK's. That weapon has been around since before the occurrence of the Zone. Some guys do find other weapons in buildings and warehouses. Even if you find something differnet it will most likely need serious repair.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_23">
    <text>Yes, I understand what you are saying.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_24">
    <text>There is always a circulation of weapons in the Zone. Trading with other stalkers.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_25">
    <text>Hó, we shall allow, with the standard military weapon all is clear, but in fact at you is full also of other weapon. Here and FN-2000 it is possible to purchase?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_26">
    <text>Hm-at-at ... Happens, stalkers with itself take, before in the Zone to get and become stalkers. Speak still, pair foreign militarists came to us. With themselves militarians carry Any guns. Yes you and itself see, it is much less than such weapon, and it is more expensive.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_27">
    <text>Sometime I get absolutely new weapons.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_28">
    <text>A good dealer always has secrets, and has connections with the external world. In general, if necessary, it is possible for everything to get, for greater money, naturally.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_29">
    <text>Is it is possible to address you?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_291">
    <text>You might have money but I don't. I gotta work hard for money. Excuse me, to work I must go. Too much time I spent on discussion with you. That you will buy?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_3">
    <text>At times I get tired of the Zone. You such did not notice behind others stalkers?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_33">
    <text>Happens certainly, the Zone does break stalkers down. Tough survivers are seldom met. Though there are exceptions.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_34">
    <text>Clearly, we must considier everything and everyone.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_35">
    <text>Well you're a guy that does not miss much. Vodka cures everything.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_36">
    <text>And what kind of exceptions?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_37">
    <text>Way back when one of the first Stalker's in the Zone had visited here. Beldug was his name. And so rumoirs say the Zone changed him. Here he lucky was, in spite of the fact that most loners don't make it through the Zone. He was always alive and always with artifacts, and his wounds healed like the pseudo-dog.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_38">
    <text>So where is he now?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_39">
    <text>Yeah it's stupid to think that he's dead. He had any and every accessory for a weapon. He had artifacts hung on his belt, along with a few pistols. God only knows how this stuff helped him. Certainly the others could not understand such nonsense. They say he once used an RPG to attach a rope to some kind of machine. There was a group of stalkers that met him and said he raised their spirits by telling them really funny jokes.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_391">
    <text>Interesting.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_4">
    <text>How did you get here?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_barmen_stories_44">
    <text>That doesn't concern you. Is there anything else you want to know?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story2_0">
    <text>Can you tell me something else?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story2_1">
    <text>Yes I have had a lot of adventures. I just just keep them to myself. I remember a scary one. There was this deserted tunnel. It was somewhere near the abandoned station. There were scavengers there. An emission had happened the day before. I needed to travel a few more kilometers. After checking my map I had realized that there is no other way except through this abandoned tunnel. I hadn't heard of any stories about this tunnel except that there may be some anomalies there. Anyway I go in and the silence was errie. The end of the tunnel was not visible, only the circle of my flashlight in front of me could I see. I threw ten bolts to pass by all sorts of anomalies. Suddenly I heard water dripping and later heard a rattle. I stopped and took off my rucksack and listened. Yikes! I heard screeching, moaning and groaning some twenty paces ahead. Well curiosity had me so I pulled out my USP and kept going. Sounds similar to a rickety wagon could be heard. I came up and looked... a woman! Honest! She was confused, looked about thirty or forty, and lies in tatters, muttering something unintelligible. I lowered my USP. This woman you see, needed help. And, you know, I just could not undestanding why a woman would be in the Zone, and in a dark tunnel yet. I got there just in time. A Fracture approached and I shot it in the forehead. Well, that reaction was valiant. I then got my rucksack and gave her a medkit. After all we have lost to many souls in the Zone. Many have died in vain. The Zone is not to joke with. And here we have a woman! Anyway we parted and continued with our travels.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story2_2">
    <text>Come on, you imagined this, perhaps.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story2_3">
    <text>Really, it's true, ask God, everything is all true. Remember my words Strelok, 'Something here in the Zone is planned, and that's not a good thing.'</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_0">
    <text>Do you have any stories? I'm bored out of my mind.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_1">
    <text>Certainly! I know a few! Have you heard about the 'Artful Oldman'?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_2">
    <text>The Artful Oldman?</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_3">
    <text>What? Are you serious? You haven't heard of the Artful Oldman? Man, you missed out!</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_4">
    <text>Tell me about him then!</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_5">
    <text>How bout' some other time, I don't have the time now.</text>
</string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_6">
    <text>Okay then, keep drinking your vodka, Artful Oldman.</text>
