    <text>Good for you Strelok you got into the lab. It is very important to study the installation at that location. Try to disable it so that we can investigate it.</text>

    <text>Listen, the prototype cannot, for too long a time, protect you from strong affects. So when you get a strong effect, then you turn on the timer. When time expires the prototype will cease to protect you. Be careful and do not forget about the timer.</text>

    <text>Excellent work Strelok! Radiation is turned off and you are still alive. We have a couple of military helicopters killing off zombies. So be careful not to get hit by the shelling. Oh, by the way, stop by to visit us in the bunker.</text>
