    <text>Entry 1: "... at the same time, we watched the whole process from beginning to end, despite the fact that the Monolith fighters surrounded the 'Springboard' in a tight ring, trying to close off any possible observation of the transmutation process and the artifact itself. But Artyom was in a rather advantageous position, and he managed to examine the artifact thrown into the anomaly through binoculars. It turned out to be a 'Snotty Porcupine' (a strange name, but it is the original one given by the creator stalker. We verified this data). Nine hours later, already at night, the anomaly threw the artifact back out. Now we have to take it from the Monoliths. Artyom suggested doing this during their next prayer to the 'Monolith'. It will start in 40 minutes. After returning, I want to put in a good word for this sensible guy. Vladislav Leonidovich, I think you will support..." \n\nEntry 2: "... I will dump the data in fragments to a flash drive, duplicate it. We dealt with the Monoliths quite quickly while they were performing some strange ritual around a black rectangle brought by one of them instead of a backpack (I initially thought it was a satchel, but it turned out to be a portable altar (!); Vladislav Leonidovich, I think this fact will be of interest to both Russian and foreign colleagues). Artyom opened fire from his 'Vintorez', and I added a couple of grenades from the underbarrel launcher. The main fears, to our joy, were not justified. The modified artifact remained unharmed. After two days of our trek, I noted the following qualities of the 'Stone Porcupine' (we gave the name considering its properties and origin from the 'Snotty Porcupine'): this artifact, which I would classify as an absolute, reduces the radiation dose received by a person by 50 mSv/hr! Besides this rarest quality, the 'Stone Porcupine' reduces a person's sensitivity to electric shock, effectively reduces bleeding, and adds stamina..." \n\nEntry 3: "... we are being chased. Monoliths, about fifteen people. We tried to break away – it didn't work. They are gradually squeezing us in a ring. I will leave the flash drive with the duplicate information to Artyom Inkin, and I will try to delay the pursuers myself..."</text>

Brother Roman claims that this changed 'Shell' worked miracles – Brother Roman almost didn't feel the psi-attacks of the burers! Besides this, the artifact somehow removed a large portion of radiation that Brother Roman received. He also noticed that all the time he wore this artifact, he didn't want to eat.

    <text>... anyway, it was like this: On the night of July seventh, half a month ago. In short, in building #3 a 'Connecting Rod' surfaced - a wandering 'Burner' anomaly, damn it. I remained alone in this building. Max and Yurka Sevastopol left, although how - I still don't get it... we drank heavily. Just as I gathered to make a bed in the corner – opa! Fire from the wall! I was drunk and at first thought that Timur Marinade fixed the found infantry flamethrower and is pranking with it. Then thought that a gas pipe burst in the walls, there was a kitchen behind the wall once. Then remembered that gas here, in the pipes, ran out fifteen years ago. Got confused a little, started pouring water. But when I saw the flame moving along the wall, I realized, but it was too late. I managed to rip my HK G36 off the nail, but not the bag with the 'Soul' found two days ago. I was very upset, drank. And four hours later my 'Soul' falls out of the fire! Only glows funny, like a lamp. Well, I grabbed it and into the container. Woke up in the morning, look: the guys are roasting a boar on the 'Burner'. \n\nHere I immediately remembered about the 'Soul'. Warned Max, and trudged to the eggheads. Getting there was fun. Well, that's another story. Got there, gave this 'Soul' for measurements. Sakhar scratched his bald head for a long time after them. "The artifact, besides improving human health," - he says, - "has gained the ability to reduce radiation dose". Also, this art (I named it 'Soul Drop', sounds cool) adds fatigue. Sakhar tried to persuade me to sell it for a long time, but I didn't buy it. I already had a plan born by that time: throw this art into the 'Burner' one more time and see what happens, and then bring it to Sakhar for measurements again. He scratched his skull for a long time again, but agreed. I took my 'Soul Drop' and moved to the tunnel. There are tons of these 'Burners' there. Threw it, waiting. After six hours it started to appear, but wouldn't jump out of the anomaly. Barely got it out, got singed. Almost became as bald as Sakhar. Brought it for measurement and turned out right! This art (I named it 'Fiery Soul') began to protect from radiation twice as well! No, I shouldn't have skipped entering the institute. I'd be a professor, an academician there... \n\nAnyway, I went to the 'Burner' for the third time, like, damn, the Old Man to the blue sea. On the way dropped a couple of zombies. One turned out to be former Mikha Cameroon. I drank for his peace later. What a fate, bitch! Just a month ago I drank with him, and today a bullet in the head... may the earth be... I threw the 'Fiery Soul' into the 'Burner' and started waiting again. Only very long. It jumped out only after 10 hours (good thing I didn't have to poke into the anomaly this time). I managed to take a nap during this time... Glows so joyfully. I picked up the art and moved to the eggheads. There's already a whole brigade on alert there, feeding me coffee with cognac, fussing with the artifact themselves. I came up with a name for it under the secular mood with coffee and Hennessy – 'Crystal Soul'. The eggheads are gasping there, admiring, saying that this hyp... hyperdif... anyway, 'Crystal Soul' both improves health and received some unprecedented indicator for radiation protection. In the morning I easily got to the 'Burner' again. Threw my precious 'Crystal Soul' into the anomaly. \n\nWaited long. Look - the art jumped out. I didn't understand anything, the glow didn't change a damn bit. Well, I think, to hell with you, if you don't want to - don't. Started walking back, look – a wandering 'Electro' is coming in the passage. No way to pass. I sat, sat, then I think: "Let me throw my art into the 'Electro'"! Turned out like in the 'Burner' – it disappeared there and jumped back out in just an hour. The light coming off is completely different! I waited for the 'Electro' to migrate further, and went my way. Brought the 'Crystal Soul' to Yantar, gave it to Sakhar. He was gone for a long time. Comes out of the lab, eyes glowing behind glasses, really like a psycho. Says it's some kind of absolute. If previously trans... transm..., anyway, the changed 'Soul' reduced human stamina, then this art besides health improvement and radiation protection, increases, not decreases stamina. I made decent dough from the eggheads for studying my 'Soul' then...</text>

    <text>... Found Vanka Four Fingers in the village. I hid there from a pack of dogs. Sitting, from the open cellar hearing the crackle of a Geiger counter. I immediately grabbed my gun: you never know, maybe some bandit or merc hid there. Looked, and he is lying there face down in 'Fruit Punch'. I only recognized him by the stupid bandana – red, with hammer-and-sickle emblems. And only four hours since we parted, he went ahead, and I waited for Vadik Rosy to pass the package. Shame, damn... Well, anyway, I put on a gas mask and climbed to pull him out. Couldn't understand for a long time how he fell there, after all, he's been trampling the Zone for the fourth year, until I saw that someone snapped his neck. I, plainly, immediately changed my mind about burying him in the ground. Who knows what hostess prepared canned food from an experienced stalker for herself. And whether this very hostess is grazing somewhere nearby. Quickly looted him, trying not to touch the clothes, took off the backpack, arts from the belt. Didn't take his favorite TOZ, 'Fruit Punch' ate the gun significantly. And bailed from there quickly. Vanka had only three arts: 'Droplet', 'Urchin' and these 'Grandmother's Beads' of his. 'Droplet' and 'Urchin' were dangling on his belt at the back. But 'Grandmother's Beads' landed in the 'Fruit Punch'. Thought the artifact was done for, but turned out the art is intact, only glows weirdly. Well, while I got to Freedom guys, I tested it. It became different. I called it 'Great Grandmother's Beads' to myself. Stops bleeding on the count of one. This, what's it called, raises tone. Saved from bullets nicely when I ran into a military zombie. Only started radiating stronger than 'Grandmother's Beads'. I'll probably sell it to scientists, and get myself new gear.</text>

This is their second migration wave after the last Blowout. We already had casualties among the staff. Responding to our call for help, Mr. Alexey Astronomer's group completely destroyed the mutants! We believe that monetary reward does not fully reflect the depth of our gratitude and in order to support our further cooperation, we are sending you information about the generation of the hyper-modificate 'Snotty Porcupine'. We apologize for the somewhat vulgar name, but it, invented by the creator of this hyper-modificate, describes the essence of this artifact as best as possible. I hope 'Duty' fighters possess proper sense of humor and will react adequately to this artifact and its name! To obtain the 'Snotty Porcupine', it is necessary to place the artifact 'Electric Porcupine' in the 'Fruit Punch' anomaly for two hours. I would like to note that this hyper-modificate has a rare indicator for blocking radiation. A person receives only 45 percent of the amount of roentgens he would have received without wearing this hyper-modificate on the belt. Besides this, it also very effectively stops bleeding and adds stamina. The unpleasant side of the 'Snotty Porcupine' is that it increases human sensitivity to electric shock, and it is uncomfortable to wear due to the constantly oozing incomprehensible mucus. The substance is harmless, but creepily unpleasant. In general, our team believes that such a small inconvenience as mucus will not discourage your fighters from using this hyper-modificate!\n\nSincerely, member of RAS, Academician Sakharov

To Director of Research Department 'K-32'\n
Professor Sazonov Nikolai Dmitrievich\n\nDear Nikolai Dmitrievich, we have completed a series of experiments on the 'Dummy' artifact. During experiments 7 (seven) 'Dummy' artifacts underwent destruction, 5 (five) 'Dummy' artifacts underwent degradation, 1 (one) 'Dummy' artifact in a series of transmutations showed positive results. \n\nThe 'Dummy' artifact upon placement in 'Electro' anomaly after 3 hours, 1 minute, 43 seconds receives the following characteristics: increases resistance to fire, slightly increases stamina, strengthens susceptibility to electric shock. Working title of the modificate – 'Fiery Dummy'. \n\nUpon subsequent placement of the 'Fiery Dummy' modificate in 'Electro' anomaly after 6 hours, 3 minutes, 12 seconds the artifact receives the following characteristics: strongly increases resistance to fire, increases stamina, strengthens carrier's susceptibility to electric shock. Working title of the meso-modificate – 'Bright Dummy'. \n\nUpon subsequent placement of the 'Bright Dummy' meso-modificate in 'Electro' anomaly after 8 hours, 4 minutes exactly the artifact receives the following characteristics: strongly increases resistance to fire, strongly increases stamina, strongly increases susceptibility to electric shock. Working title of the hyper-modificate – 'Moon Dummy'. \n\nAt this, experiments on transmutation of the 'Dummy' artifact were continued in the same anomaly. Unlike projects 'Scrap', 'Sister', 'Invisible' and 'Lord of the Flies', this experiment was crowned with success! \n\nUpon placement of the 'Moon Dummy' hyper-modificate in 'Electro' anomaly, rejection of the artifact did not occur. After 12 hours, 3 minutes, 56 seconds the artifact received properties of absolute class, namely: significantly increases resistance to fire, slightly increases stamina, significantly increases resistance to electric shock. Working title of the absolute – 'Pudding'. \n\nFurther placement of the obtained absolute in 'Electro' anomaly led to nothing - the anomaly rejects the artifact. \n\nI consider that our group arrived at a brilliant result of research on transmutation of the 'Dummy' artifact. Thus, I consider project 'Deceiver' successfully completed. Full observation records transferred to the server. \n\nHead of research group '7', V. A. Avakyan
