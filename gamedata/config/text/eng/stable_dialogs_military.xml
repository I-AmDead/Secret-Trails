    <text>Hello, brother. I'm a Duty member and we're here on a mission. Would you like to join us?</text>

    <text>Not particularly interested.</text>

    <text>I'm up for it.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_102">
    <text>Excellent. There behind that hill is the main breeding ground of those bastards - the 'free' ones as they say - and me and my boys are going to stir it up real good. There's just one little problem. The base has only one entrance and it is well guarded. We thought of busting a hole in the fence, but their sniper in the tower won't let us. I don't want to send my guys to catch his bullets, but you he'll let you come close and definitely won't shoot on sight. If you take him out, we'll owe you. Plus if it goes as planned you'll be able to take any equipment from the base. Whatever you want.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_103">
    <text>Go on.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_104">
    <text>I've already told you, all you need to do is knock off the sniper in that tower above the fence. So, what do you say?</text>

    <text>No, I'm not ready yet.</text>
</string>

    <text>I'll try.</text>

    <text>There's one small problem. Since the base has only one entrance, a well-guarded one at that, we quickly thought of making another one, but...</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_107">
    <text>But what?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_108">
    <text>I sent my guy at night to blow a hole in the fence. Well, either their sniper is too good or it just wasn't our day, but my guy went down. Now the dynamite is on the fence, but we can't blow it up.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_109">
    <text>Why?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_110">
    <text>I don't want to send my boys under that asshole's bullets, but you stand a great chance of taking him out. He won't shoot you on sight for sure. What do you say?</text>

    <text>How much will I get?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_112">
    <text>Now that's talking business. 2000 from us for the sniper, plus a whole lot of gear at the base. Lots of a dead bodies there, I can promise you that. So, you can help us and help yourself. How about it?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_120">
    <text>Deal.</text>

    <text>We're about to blow up the fence and get the party going. I can see you're a good shooter - maybe you could take care of the tower snipers? With snipers out of the way, we'll have an easier time getting to that spaz Lukash.</text>

    <text>Go to the tower, there's a Dragunov and some ammo there. You'll be able to pick them off from above, but don't come back down right away, you need to watch out for our bullets. Is the assignment clear?</text>

    <text>What's this place?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_1">
    <text>We call it the 'Barrier', that's what it basically is. It's the last normal outpost this side of the Zone's center. It's a sort of buffer, you know, between the people and Wild Territory.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_2">
    <text>What is there beyond it?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_3">
    <text>Only death... or those who server the 'Monolith'. "Our Monolith! In your name we...", Damn! In short, no one needs to go there. That's why we're based here, trying to prevent the muck from infesting the entire Zone. Like some kind of Jedis, hehe. We also detain the really stupid ones or at least try not to let them creep into the center.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_4">
    <text>Why do you do that?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_5">
    <text>Who else but us? Duty? They are the shit when it comes to eradicating mutants and eliminating unwanted stalkers. You should try some time to make them actually do something useful! Do you see them here? No? That's what I mean. We, on the other hand, do not aim to destroy all the creatures that live here. A barrier, a normal barrier, that should be enough. As long as nothing evil crosses the line.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_6">
    <text>And what if something does?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_7">
    <text>Anything can happen. Anything. I don't want to...</text>

<string id="mil_guard_arsenal_dialog_1000">
    <text>Halt! Access to the arsenal is restricted to Freedom members only.</text>

    <text>There, now you can enter the arsenal. Except there's a little problem.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_guard_arsenal_dialog_2001">
    <text>What problem?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_guard_arsenal_dialog_2002">
    <text>Don't sweat it, it's nothing terrible. The lock is jammed, that's all. If you really can't wait, just shoot it to pieces, I'll replace it later.</text>

    <text>Ahh, now that's another matter. Only Hell knows what's going on here! A couple of our folks went into the village and never came back. Heck, we're not keen on dying yet! We're sitting here, deciding what to do next.</text>

    <text>Hey, bro, way to freak out last night!</text>

    <text>Meaning?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_203">
    <text>We were just sitting around and then you barge in piss drunk! You barge right into the village, right into those bloodsuckers! Good thing we were there to put some brakes on you and make you sleep it off.</text>

    <text>And what are you doing here?</text>

    <text>Thank you.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_4">
    <text>No. Our guys were supposed to go to the old water tower. That's probably where they went down. Well if you made a deal with Skinflint go there and check it out. Write down an address, will you? We'll write to your family if something goes wrong.</text>

</string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_505">
    <text>No one knows what's going on here! Looks like the village is now home to a pack of bloodsuckers. A couple of our folks went into the village and never came back. Hell if we're going in there! We're sitting here deciding who should.</text>

    <text>Since you helped our guys stalker you can now count on getting some rest on our territory, as well as our help. Oh, and my personal appreciation, here is a bit of legal tender for you. From this moment on I'm enlisting you in our group.</text>

<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1001">
    <text>Hey, stalker. What do you need?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_10011">
    <text>Nothing much, really.</text>

<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_10012">
    <text>Then let's get out of here, Ok? Time is money.</text>
</string>

    <text>I saw a group of Duty members in a farmstead near your base. About eight men, well equipped.</text>

    <text>Damn, these punks just won't settle down! Fine, we'll have to teach them a lesson. Hey stalker want to help us for a reward? Talk to Max our chief. You two can get a crew together and root out those suckers.</text>

    <text>You're a speedy one stalker. Ok, so do you mind helping us out with something else? I'm ashamed to admit that there's a traitor among us. His name is Pavlik. He's leaking valuable info and that must be stopped.</text>
</string>

    <text>In what way?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1300">
    <text>You must follow him to the farmstead and discover whose rat he is. He doesn't know you and isn't aware of our conversation either, so...</text>

    <text>You think I have work for you to do?</text>

    <text>Perhaps.</text>

<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_13003">
    <text>We've learned there's a rat in our midst by the name of Pavlik. He's leaking valuable information. We know that for a fact, but don't have solid proof. Your task is to spy him out and discover who he is singing to. I think he's going to a meeting tonight. Follow him quietly. Just be careful that he doesn't see you, he's extremely cautious. After you find out the identity of his connection, bump him off and the other guy too for good measure.</text>

    <text>There's one thing I wanted to ask you about.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1500">
    <text>He just left, so you'll have to catch up with him. Remember that you can and should bump him off, but only after he's exposed the agent he's ratting to. You'll have to eliminate the other guy too.</text>

<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_1501">
    <text>Understood.</text>

    <text>Hrm... What is it?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_30021">
    <text>Sadly, I have to admit there's a traitor in our ranks. His name is Pavlik. He's leaking valuable information and that must be terminated.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_3003">
    <text>Exactly. I think he will go to a meeting some time between 10 and 11 p.m. It's going to be dark enough, so no one sees him, but at this time the mutants won't be out yet. Go forth, stalker! After you're done, you will become a member of our group. Remember you must catch the traitor red-handed! You've got to take him down during his meet, otherwise the mission will have failed. Kill the other dude too.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_4001">
    <text>You're still here?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_5001">
    <text>Great job, Strelok! Here, take this, your payment for taking care of the traitor. You're welcome to rest in our territory whenever you want and you can also count on our help. Only, there's one more thing I'd like you to do for me. Are you too tired?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_5002">
    <text>No! What exactly?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_5003">
    <text>If you feel up to it go to the outpost near the Red Forest exit. We've had reports claiming that either mutants or Monolith are planning a new attempt to break through there. The guys need help.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_5004">
    <text>Well, you did help the guys at the barrier, so relax now.</text>

<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_7002">
    <text>What chance?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_7003">
    <text>Certain things point to the fact that very soon Monolith is gonna try to break through from the Red Forest side. You gotta go see Cap,- he's the commander at the Barrier and see if he needs any help. Well, it's pretty obvious he does, really...</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_leader_start_dialog_7004">
    <text>Ok, I'll do it.</text>

    <text>You failed the mission so we might as well kiss those documents good-bye. You have disappointed me.</text>

    <text>Well you trashed that mission. Bummer! But still you did help the guys at the Barrier. You can relax in our territory. In case something comes up, we'll help you.</text>

    <text>Got any work?</text>

    <text>We'll talk after we take down those Duty assholes.</text>

    <text>Ok.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_1001">
    <text>Lukash said that you'll do. Did you see them... at the farmstead?</text>

<string id="mil_max_dialog_1100">
    <text>No.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_1101">

</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_1102">
    <text>Sure.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_1200">
    <text>Yes.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_1201">
    <text>Are there many of them?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_1210">
    <text>Can't say for sure. I don't think there's too many.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_1220">
    <text>About six to eight people. Reasonably equipped.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_2001">
    <text>Go to Lukash.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_3001">
    <text>Got any questions?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_3002">
    <text>Yes. Lukash told me to intercept the Duty courier on the way from Red Forest to Dead City. Could you tell me the best place to do that?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_3003">
    <text>Hmm. Best thing would be to catch the Duty courier before he reaches the farmstead near the passage to Dead City. Reinforcements are sure to be waiting for him there, so you'd have trouble dealing with them all. Plus, that way you'd have to pass through the village, which is a bad thing. Better go east of the village and fast.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_3004">
    <text>What's there in the village?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_3005">
    <text>Believe me nothing good. Lots of mutants roaming about and some anomalies, too. I'll tell you about that later.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_4001">
    <text>Are congratulations in order?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_4002">
    <text>Yes.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_4003">
    <text>I see you're the right kind of guy! Would you mind doing another small job for me? Get it done and I'll give you my Desert Eagle. A great piece and packs a wicked punch!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_4004">
    <text>But what am I supposed to do?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_4005">
    <text>There's this one guy who dug in at the swamp. My boys saw him rushing from the village through hedge and ditch. He must have seen something that knocked a few screws loose in his head. Now he's shooting anyone who comes in sight. You've got to find out what it was he saw, because our people are too afraid to go into the village now.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_40051">
    <text>No not this time.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_400511">
    <text>Well, whatever.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_40052">
    <text>Here's the memory stick I got from the crazy stalker.</text>

    <text>Hey, thanks, stalker! Take this gun you've earned it.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_400522">
    <text>Got any ammo for it?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_400523">
    <text>Just what's in the magazine. Sorry that's all I have. Go see Skinflint he might have some.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_4006">
    <text>I'll try.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_4007">
    <text>Good luck, then. Don't forget that there's an old minefield, and with the help of a few good old bolts you can go around them.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_5001">
    <text>So what did you learn? What happened to that psycho?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_5002">
    <text>Here's a flash drive. I got it from the crazy guy.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_6001">
    <text>What, already?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_7001">
    <text>What do you want to know?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_8001">
    <text>What's up, stalker! Whatcha got?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_8002">
    <text>I've got business to discuss. Can you show me the way to your boss?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_8003">
    <text>You want Lukash, he's our leader. Go to the main building.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_9001">
    <text>I see you managed alright. Give the documents to Lukash.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_9100">
    <text>Go to Lukash and make your report, then we'll talk, aright?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_9101">
    <text>Ok.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_0">
    <text>Man, you're in the Freedom base! Relax and make yourself at home!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_1">
    <text>I see.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_2">
    <text>Behave, Ok? Got it? Try fooling around and you'll be sorry. We had a slow-witted one here once. He pissed everyone off so bad that we made him take a hike in the minefield naked. You should have heard Skinflint cursing when that dude's arm fell on top of his head! That was something special... yeah... So, you got the idea?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_3">
    <text>Gotcha.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_4">
    <text>Good man! Dismissed.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_0">
    <text>Ah, a rookie... Come over here for a sec.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_1">
    <text>I don't get it.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_10">
    <text>Where are you going? Stay! It's nice here and we'll be having dinner tonight.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_11">
    <text>Nah, I'm not that hungry.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_12">
    <text>What?! Shit, why didn't you tell me that before! We've just been wasting time. Get lost, buttface. And this time I'm dead serious.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_2">
    <text>What didn't you get? Oh, you haven't heard the story about the slow-witted ones, huh?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_3">
    <text>No, I haven't.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_4">
    <text>Alright, look. Think about it, these are hungry times.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_5">
    <text>Meaning?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_6">
    <text>Well, that's easy! A hungry soldier is a bad soldier. And there's so many of us.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_7">
    <text>And?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_8">
    <text>Where would we get that much meat? And look, here you are!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_9">
    <text>Got it.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1000">
    <text>Man, you broke it?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001">
    <text>Broken?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1002">
    <text>Ahhh, you're not here to ask for my help? Whew! I'm getting sick and tired of that. Soon as something breaks, they run to me and start whining about it.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1003">
    <text>And who are you?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1004">
    <text>I'm a mechanic. A Mr-Fix-It of sorts. I repair guns and whatever else you bring to me. Right now I'm working on this car, a Moskvich 2140. I'm gonna turbocharge this puppy.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1005">
    <text>How's it going?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1006">
    <text>Pfft! Nothing but rubbish. I'm totally beat. Listen, you got any vodka on you? I'd, umm... you... want a nice scope? The best optics there are!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1100">
    <text>No.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1101">
    <text>It's your loss. If you have some, come in, don't be a stranger.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1102">
    <text>Ok.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1200">
    <text>Here, take it.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1201">
    <text>Well thanks! How nice of you. Now I'll have something to help me relax later on.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1202">
    <text>Good luck.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2000">
    <text>Don't distract me, I'm thinking.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_4">
    <text>No way, did you really bring vodka?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1001">
    <text>What is it?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1002">
    <text>Here's a tricky question, where do I go for things like artifacts and weapons?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1003">
    <text>You come to me, with money. Or go to the village and get them for free, but the risks are much higher there.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1004">
    <text>The village?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1005">
    <text>The village. It's full of anomalies. Rookies stumble on them all the time. Our guys just left to go there. You can join them if you want.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1006">
    <text>I hear ya.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_2001">
    <text>What good things did you bring me?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3001">
    <text>What will you be needing?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3002">
    <text>Nothing... just looking around.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3003">
    <text>You should do something useful instead. Specially as I've got something you might be interested in. Want to earn, huh?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3004">
    <text>Interesting.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3005">
    <text>I can give you a Crystal if you do me one particular favor. A nasty situation has developed lately. No one has been bringing any artifacts from the village. They are too scared to go there. They say bloodsuckers have settled in there. These days I can't even send anyone. In fact I'm very close of asking Duty for help!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3006">
    <text>Go on.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3007">
    <text>A couple of guys went to the village and didn't come back, and the other three are just sitting there on the outskirts. If you kill the bloodsuckers I'll give you a Crystal. What do you say?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_30071">
    <text>Not right now.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_30072">
    <text>Hey, it's your call. Sooner or later someone will clear them off. Meanwhile the Crystal is rare and rather expensive too.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3008">
    <text>I'll do it.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3009">
    <text>Oh, that's swell. If you find more stuff like this, bring it over. I'll pay a good price.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3101">
    <text>And?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3110">
    <text>There're sitting there, looking around.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3111">
    <text>If you help them in their hunt I'll give you an artifact called Crystal. So what do you say?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3200">
    <text>We had a chat and then went on a walk across the village trying to catch some mutant.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3201">
    <text>And? Cut to the chase already!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3300">
    <text>We took down some kind of beast, but the guys went down, too. Right as we came to the water tower they all grabbed their heads and I had blood in my eyes, too. That creature affects your brain. I killed the thing, but it was too late to help the guys.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3301">
    <text>That blows. Murk was a skilled stalker. Damn shame. Well, take this artifact for helping the boys.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3310">
    <text>Well, guys went hunting and I returned here.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3311">
    <text>I see.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3400">
    <text>Can I stock up on some equipment here?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3401">
    <text>For a price anything is possible.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3500">
    <text>I've already dealt with them.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3501">
    <text>Damn, stalker! You're as explosive as diarrhea! Ok, a deal is a deal, here's your Crystal.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4001">
    <text>So how did the hunting go?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4002">
    <text>I killed the monsters.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4003">
    <text>How tough was it?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4004">
    <text>Average.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4005">
    <text>Hmm, interesting. All kind of guck is spreading from the center of the Zone. And where does it come from? Ok take this for your troubles.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5001">
    <text>But I asked you to kill those bloodsuckers in the village!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5002">
    <text>I changed my mind.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5003">
    <text>No problem. Of course, in that case there will be no reward.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5004">
    <text>Fine with me.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5010">
    <text>I'll try.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_6001">
    <text>Uh-huh, so you didn't settle that little problem. Therefore I'll keep the artifact for myself.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_6002">
    <text>No arguments from me.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7001">
    <text>People have been saying you took care of these bloodsuckers in the village. Is that true?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7002">
    <text>That's right.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7003">
    <text>Was it tough?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7004">
    <text>Nahhh.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7005">
    <text>Hmm, interesting. All kind of vile creatures are spreading from the center of the Zone. I wonder where they actually come from? Anyway take this for your troubles.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_8001">
    <text>So what have you brought with you?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_0">
    <text>Is there a cook around here?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_1">
    <text>Sure is, how could we do without one! What the heck do you need him for, anyway?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_2">
    <text>Well, I could go for a big fat hamburger.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_3">
    <text>He's in his kitchen. Usually, he sits there and mutters.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_4">
    <text>Mutters?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_5">
    <text>What did you expect? A drunk is a drunk. If he couldn't cook, we'd have gotten rid of him a long time ago. He's in the kitchen. I'll tell you how to get there.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_6">
    <text>Thanks for the information.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_7">
    <text>No problem.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_0">
    <text>Who's the boss here?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_1">
    <text>And what's your business?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_2">
    <text>I've got information for him.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_3">
    <text>Lukash is our leader. Go to HQ in the main building.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_4">
    <text>Got it. Thanks.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_10">
    <text>Same to you. What brings you here?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_100">
    <text>Who's the boss around here? I've got business to discuss with him.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1000">
    <text>Lukash is our leader, you can find him in the main building. But as you enter make sure to put your piece away unless you wanna get shot for nothing.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_10000">
    <text>Say what?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_100000">
    <text>We had some shit happen once. A killer got this close to dropping Lukash. We stopped taking any risks after that.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1000000">
    <text>Got it.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_10000000">
    <text>Ok, you can go.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_20">
    <text>So-so. Keep out don't bother me.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_3">
    <text>Greetings.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_30">
    <text>Halt! Who goes there?!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_31">
    <text>A South African swallow!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_32">
    <text>Ha-ha! Ok! You can pass.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_4">
    <text>What's this swamp nearby?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_41">
    <text>A real radioactive puddle. Better not touch it, or you'll get enough rads to make your navel button unwind. There's a guy living in the middle of it, and he doesn't let anyone come close. Well, I can feel for him, who'd want to mix with idiots? 'Cause a normal person would definitely stay away from there.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_42">
    <text>Who is that guy, anyway?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_43">
    <text>Hell if I know. They say he's one of our folks that's been to the village.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_44">
    <text>What village?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_45">
    <text>Well, there is one little hamlet nearby. Full of mutants and anomalies. I haven't been there yet. I only came to this base just recently. Ask Max he's been here a hundred years.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_5">
    <text>Listen where can I stock up on some ammo? Rostok is kind of a long walk from here and I don't feel like going there without supplies.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_51">
    <text>Go to the main building and you'll find a supplier on the first floor.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_6">
    <text>Whassup, rambling man? Looking to drop in at our place, huh?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_601">
    <text>Something like that.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_602">
    <text>How about joining us, eh?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_603">
    <text>How about, NOT. I'm here on business.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_604">
    <text>C'mon, join us. It's a lot of fun.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_605">
    <text>I'll think about it.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_607">
    <text>Can I come in?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_608">
    <text>No.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_609">
    <text>Please.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_610">
    <text>What is the password?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_611">
    <text>How the hell would I know.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_612">
    <text>No password, no getting in.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_613">
    <text>How about a hint?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_614">
    <text>Yeah riiiight!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_615">
    <text>C'mon please let me in. I can't spend the night in the fields can I?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_616">
    <text>Why not the weather is fine, almost like summer. Well alright, if you pass the test you can, if not get lost.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_617">
    <text>The test?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_618">
    <text>Sure. Three things every real man has to know.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_619">
    <text>Ok shoot, err, I mean go ahead.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_620">
    <text>Ok, the easiest one first. Ready? Alright, what is Pamela Anderson's bra size?</text>

    <text>Good job! I can tell you're the right kind of man!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_6207">
    <text>Yep, I am.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_6208">
    <text>A bit more difficult now! Ok what's the magazine capacity for the Russian submachine gun Bizon?</text>

<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_6404">
    <text>Swallow!</text>

    <text>How am I supposed to know that?! Do you even have the answer?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_6406">
    <text>Of course not. That's the thing, I can't seem to solve that one. Well, Ok, you can pass.</text>

    <text>Whoa, man!</text>

<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_91">
    <text>You're a pushy sort! I repeat, what's the capacity of the magazine that goes into the Russian SMG Bizon?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_5001">
    <text>Looks like we took them all down. I say that's enough for today. Thanks for your help! Here take this, a little bit of money to cheer you up. And also some useful info on your PDA. Check it out.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_0">
    <text>Good day, how do you do?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_1">
    <text>All right. Had a strange thing happen to me the other day. If you want, I can tell you.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_2">
    <text>So let's chat.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_3">
    <text>I was returning from the Yantar lake with loot. It was a dark evening, and silence everywhere. I don't like it when the Zone it really quiet. I don't know how anyone could feel safe in a silent Zone. I'm walking along a path, than go up a slope to a highway, knowing that there are not a lot of anomalies, and on the highway there aren't any at all, so I relax and didn't watch where my feet were before taking a step. So I walked and walked than suddenly I heard someone's voice that seemed far away. But it was hard for me to understand the distance between me and owner of that voice. I took a bolt and threw it into some bushes. Looks like it is all clear of damned anomalies. I towards the voice and about 400-500 metres noticed a figure with something like flames on it. I thought maybe it was an artifact, but he shouted like he was in pain. Ssuddenly I saw something going toward him, another figure, motion look like a zombie, and then another one came closer to the stalker from the marshes.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_4">
    <text>We still have mutants in the marsh, that's for sure.</text>
</string>

    <text>Stalker tried to move, he even had time to take his gun, reload and shot about 2-3 times, but it was useless. These beasts go to him until they surround him and he disappeared in this fucking heap of bodies. I recovered only after that and ran away. And the next day I hear that stalker named Anton Claw vanished, went to Yantar lake and didn't return. It's way of Zone explanation that you mustn't be greedy. But he knew that it's very very dangerous even at evening time.</text>

<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_6">
    <text>Grm... Thanks for your story. When I go to Yantar I 'll try to be more careful.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story_0">
    <text>Any advice for me?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story_1">
    <text>Advice? Ok, so come close and listen. Once one fool join us to visit central part of Zone. If we have a rest, he starts relaxing first, when we continue going he does the same the last. It's was his last rest. Controller turned him into a zombie. So moral is, if hare will be... though hare in Zone... You should be ready always, if you hear only a small rustle in bush, shoot immediately about half clip, only after that you can try to understand what it was. About Controllers they catch you if they see you, so fall down immediately. If it's all quiet, wait... and run as fast as you can and very far away from this place. It's the only way to stay alive.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story_2">
    <text>Thx for advice!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story_3">
    <text>Bring me a can of beer, I'm joking.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_0">
    <text>What can you tell me?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_1">
    <text>A stalker came here recently and told us a story. He walked and explored parts of Zone that were new for him and got into incomprehensible places. He noticed a hole which looked like a bunker or a simple tunnel or cave. You can find such things in Zone in big quantities. So he decided to enter it. It was dark there and he turned on his torch. Suddenly he noticed a Controller far away. It was too late to run back. He decided to do the usual thing and run closer to the Controller and tried to shoot it with a Kalashnikov. He pulled the trigger, misfire, reloaded, pulled the trigger again, misfire. Controller attacked with all its power. He ran very close to the Controller but couldn't fire point-blank. So the stalker bit the Controller in the nose and beat it to death with his AK. He said that the Controller wasn't sober, smelled of vodka, and bottles were everywhere.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_2">
    <text>He lies, Controllers don't like vodka.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_3">
    <text>Maybe, maybe, but that stalker has been selling vodka for a good price for a long time.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_0">
    <text>Hi, Skinflint!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_1">
    <text>Hi, rookie.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_2">
    <text>Are you an idiot?! I've been here for such a long time that you can't even imagine!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_3">
    <text>For a long time. Have you passed the test to become experienced?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_4">
    <text>What test?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_5">
    <text>Well, haven't passed obviously. So listen, there is a ritual to become an experienced stalker, if you pass it, everyone will respect you.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_6">
    <text>Really? What do I have to do?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_7">
    <text>So, you must do it at night. The quest isn't easy, it needs full concentration and attention. If you make a mistake you don't pass. At night you need to sneak up to a sleeping wild boar and kick it as hard as you can. After that count to 10 and try to run. If you get to the camp alive you become experienced. So do you want to become an experienced stalker rookie?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_8">
    <text>Yes. Is this obligatory?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_9">
    <text>Of course, and there is no other way! Otherwise no worldly wise stalker will join you and all traders will rise their prices. It becomes a tradition.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_10">
    <text>Okay I'm ready!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_11">
    <text>Excellent! Do you want to do it tonight? There is a big herd of wild boars. And their leader is a real monster. Just for you, big, furious, with red eyes and fangs a meter long. Tonight, no weapon, no grenades. Do you want to write a will?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_12">
    <text>No thanks! So I'll go without any weapons, you say? Ok, tonight you'll see me passing this trial. Goodbye.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_13">
    <text>Wait!</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_14">
    <text>What?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_15">
    <text>Did you believe me, man?</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_16">
    <text>Yes.</text>
</string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_17">
    <text>Hey... It's... It's a joke... I'm just messing with you... I'll tell everyone this joke, no one ever believes me!!</text>
