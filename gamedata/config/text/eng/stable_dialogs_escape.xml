    <text>But I need to pass through.</text>

    <text>Tough shit. If you really need to pass through then the price is 500 rubles or some vodka</text>

    <text>Here ya go.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_start_15">
    <text>Listen up. We'll pretend for a moment it's nothing but insects around here, but what happens beyond this point is your own damn business.</text>

    <text>Alright, keep moving! Get your buns out of here before we change our mind.</text>

    <text>I don't have that much money.</text>

    <text>Buzz off Strelok. Walk or crawl the choice is yours.</text>

    <text>Hi there, what do you need?</text>

<string id="esc_lager_no_talk_31">
    <text>Our boss here wanted to see you. But that doesn't make you a welcome guest. Keep moving.</text>

    <text>Hello friend.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_12">
    <text>Hello, I need to see the Doctor.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_13">
    <text>Well I'm surprised. How do you know about Doctor?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_14">
    <text>Ghost sent me. Help me get in touch with the Doctor. It's urgent.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_15">
    <text>Well, why didn't you say so! The Doctor is in Arrows's hiding place. If you are who you say you are, you probably know where it is.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_16">
    <text>Thanks.</text>

<string id="esc_provodnik_start_21">
    <text>Hello, brother stalker.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_0">
    <text>Could you tell me more about this area?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_1">
    <text>This is the road to the Zone. If I were you I wouldn't get too close to the army outposts or let those soldiers see you. They've got orders to shoot on sight. Further north there's a damaged bridge, they've set up an outpost there. Open areas are crawling with wild dogs, so it's not a safe place for rookies. Oh and packs of mutants shows up every so often.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_10">
    <text>What about the soldiers at the bridge? I've got to get past them.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_11">
    <text>Listen you have two options. If Kuznetsov is on duty offer money and vodka. Good chance he'll let you through for a bribe. But if you're low on cash or if it's someone else's shift, there is a different way. Go on the left side of the bridge along the railway. Just make sure they don't see you. You'll come across a small tunnel that goes through the embankment under the tracks. And another thing you might see some zombies there.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_2">
    <text>What's further north beyond the army outpost?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_21">
    <text>Garbage, that’s what. Now there's a depressing place. So much contaminated shit in some area that swimming would be easier than walking.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_31">
    <text>Hello, Wolf has already sent word of you. You have any questions?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311">
    <text>Yes, how many bandits are in the camp?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_3111">
    <text>Seven or eight guys. Two by the gate and two more in the building to the right near a fire and another on the left. That's where they're keeping Nimble. Someone usually hangs around the yard as well. That's about it I guess. Shall we say a prayer and go?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_31111">
    <text>Let's go. Round up your guys.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_31112">
    <text>No, we would make too much noise. I'll go on my own.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311121">
    <text>Well suit yourself. Yell if something is up. To hell with you Rambo wannabes!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_41">
    <text>We went hunting and hunt we did. I bet Wolf will be pleased.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_51">
    <text>There's more of them! Find the bastards and take them down!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_61">
    <text>Oh man! Your a crack shot! If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't have believed it! Maybe you can do me a favor?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_71">
    <text>Well where are the stacks of enemies? Hey you! Go away!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_2">
    <text>Sorry, brother, but could you buzz off? I'm here to meet someone.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_21">
    <text>I've got a couple of questions.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_211">
    <text>Okay ask away.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_2111">
    <text>What can you tell me about the Zone?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_21111">
    <text>That's all you wanna know? Take a week off and then come back to see me. Look, my time ain't cheap and I'm kinda busy right now. Here are the basics and then you're on your own. About three kilometers North of here, you'll find the Garbage. That's the place they used to dump all the radioactive waste from the station. High radiation levels, anomalies all over the place, so there are loads of artifacts to be found there... but not very valuable. Just beware of the gangs and don't cross the Duty patrols. West of the Garbage is the former Agroprom Research Institute. Little in terms of artifacts there so you can skip it. And to the East, there's the Dark Valley. Who knows... That's a pretty weird place. It seems quiet enough, apart from a bunch of gangsters roaming around. But I got a feeling there's more to it than meets the eye. Oh, and there's the Rostok factory right beyond the Garbage. That's stalker territory. You'll find lots of clued-up folks there, they'll tell you the rest.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_2113">
    <text>I've changed my mind. Thanks anyway.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_3">
    <text>Thanks! Ok now I'm listening very carefully.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_31">
    <text>Trader told me you might know something about Strelok.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_311">
    <text>Why is everyone taking such an interest in him lately? Ok I can't say I know him personally. We did communicate though, my guys took some shots at him once. No one got hurt. It was clear his party had been waiting for someone else, so we parted in peace. Cussed each other out across a ravine and went on our separate ways. Seryi, my brother, is now in the hangar in Garbage. I'll give you his coordinates so you two can have a chat with him. He knows more about Strelok. Be careful at the exit, a small gang has settled down in those parts. By the way I had a few mutants chasing me and it doesn't look like they've given up yet. You mind helping me deal with them? It's a walk in the park really.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_3111">
    <text>Thanks for the information I appreciate it.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_5">
    <text>Medkit! Gimme a medkit!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_55">
    <text>Here you are.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_56">
    <text>Don't have one. Sorry dude.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_61">
    <text>Hey man you saved me twice and that's not something I forget. Take this it's all I have!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_611">
    <text>Thank you.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_121">
    <text>Our boss here wanted to see you. But that doesn't make you a welcomed guest. Keep moving on.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_2">
    <text>Wait, Strelok! No one at the camp is gonna to talk to you right now.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_21">
    <text>Why?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_212">
    <text>What kind of idiot would chat with a former passenger of the 'Death Truck'? First you have prove you're trustworthy and alright to deal with.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_2121">
    <text>What 'Death Truck'? What are you talking about?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_21211">
    <text>Ah, hell only knows what it really is. But whatever it is, it's bad and about as bad as it gets. Why am I talking to you about this anyway. Maybe I'm just superstitious. But you Strelok should really take a hike before something happens to you.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_2122">
    <text>What can I do to make people trust me?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_21221">
    <text>Pass Trader's test. If you're alright and you're not trigger happy and you use your head, then we'll definitely find some common ground.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_22">
    <text>Okay if that's the way it has to be.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_3">
    <text>Hello Strelok. Is there something I can do for you?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11">
    <text>Listen up Strelok you will come in handy. We could really use some help.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_111">
    <text>Continue.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1111">
    <text>I'm Fanatic and I'm filling in as the leader since Wolf left. A few Mercenaries came by here yesterday and they were some tough bastards, let me tell you. They came here and started making serious demands such as 'You've got one day to clear this camp out. It's gonna be our new base.' Tonight they're coming back and as you can imagine they won't be in the mood for a chat.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11111">
    <text>So, what are you going to do?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_111111">
    <text>We're gonna set up an ambush because a direct attack would probably be the end of us. They've got the fighting gear and everything. Plus they're trained in tactics like you can't even imagine. And all we've got here are inexperienced n00bs. So we've decided to just sit tight in these houses and make it look like we're gone. Then when the right moment comes we'll attack. Fighters like you are just the thing we could use right now. And we'd make sure to thank you properly after it's all over. You know we're good for it. So what do you say, will you help us out?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1111111">
    <text>Sure.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11111111">
    <text>Let's spend some time preparing for the fight. Here's the plan: I'll put the most hopeless rookies in houses and basements and tell them not to make a move, otherwise they might shoot the wrong guys. You and me and a couple of others will take the best positions to have an eye on the area around the fire. As soon as they come close to the fire we'll let the bullets fly. They'll be coming from the bridge and I don't think we'll have to wait long. So find yourself a hiding place with a view, then wait for my command. Take a look around, but remember that your odds aren't as good in the open. It's your call.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_111111111">
    <text>Okay.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1111112">
    <text>No I'm not ready yet.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11111121">
    <text>That's a shame. We really could use a fighter like you. I guess we'll have to do it on our own.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_21">
    <text>We are waiting for these bastards. I got a feeling they're just around the corner.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_31">
    <text>You're a real fighter Strelok! I wouldn't want to stand in your way. Ever!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_311">
    <text>Yup, something like that.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_3111">
    <text>Well you are a pretty bad dude. Here take this for helping us out. I spoke once with a soldier and he shared a recipe with me about the modification of the artifact 'Beads Grandmother of the Burer'. And personally from me, not far from the bunker Sidorovich is path - it leads to the so-called Bogs. The recipe and the transition are marked in your PDA. There is something else. Ever heard of a teleport? I could set up such a thing. You can fly directly where you want to go.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_41">
    <text>Hello Strelok glad to see you again!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_411">
    <text>Hello to you, too.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_412">
    <text>By the way, where did Wolf go?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_4121">
    <text>Well he received a message from a stalker who was passing by. He packed his things, grabbed a box of dynamite and went deep in the Zone. I'm still getting back in shape after the wounds I got in Cordon, so he asked me to look after the boys.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_0">
    <text>I've have questions.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_1">
    <text>Go ahead, I'll try to help.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_10">
    <text>Thank you.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2">
    <text>What do you know about the Zone?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_21">
    <text>I know many things. Be more specific.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_211">
    <text>What's in the center of the Zone?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2111">
    <text>Wow that's a question alright. I've been looking for the answer for two years. I still haven't found a way to the center. At least not one I could take and come back alive. My friends and I tried to break through a couple of times. I barely made it backa live, but my friends, well, some did, some didn't. You'll ask why. We were chasing our dreams, trying to make them come true.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_21111">
    <text>Can dreams come true?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_211111">
    <text>There is this beautiful story about a Wish-Granter Machine. They say there is a place in the center of the Zone where any desires can come true no matter how bizarre. But you know what? I know for a fact there's lots of ways to kick the bucket in the center of the Zone, and I don't believe in the Wish-Granting Machine anymore. Don't take that risk. I wouldn't.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_212">
    <text>How did the Zone come to be?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2121">
    <text>There was another explosion in 2006. That's how it came about. I know that's not a real answer. Very few know the whole truth, if anyone does at all.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_213">
    <text>What brought you to the Zone?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2131">
    <text>I used to work in a mine before they closed it down. I had no money and nothing to look forward to. Then I heard some rumors about the fabulous riches hidden inside the Zone. I had some experience under my belt digging for stuff, so I thought 'What the hell!'. Can't say I've become rich but some cash came my way that's for sure. This is a typical story. Most of us got here the same way.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_214">
    <text>What's the most dangerous thing in the Zone?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2141">
    <text>That's a toughy. There are so many dangers and surprises you just can't run into all of them. There's more than enough for one person anyway. I got one toe bitten off, my hair is falling out from the radiation, and half my leg got fried in a Scorcher, and one shrunken nut. Things here are real bad. Another time I happened to come face to face with a bloodsucker. Now there's a meeting I'd like to forget. So we can talk all you like, but until you experience it on your own, you won't really understand. The only advice I can give is beware of everything everywhere always.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_3">
    <text>Have you heard about a guy called Strelok?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_31">
    <text>I seem to remember he's one of the tough ones. Never actually met the man. Well I haven't come close to the center in a while and all we get here are rookies. You should find someone who hangs out deep in the Zone and have a chat with him.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_4">
    <text>What do you know about 'Death Trucks'?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_41">
    <text>I know nothing and that's fine by me, thank you!Sorry I know your situation. Too much mysticism about it. You spend a month in these parts and you can't help but become superstitious about life. Dead people in the trunk, dead people behind the wheel. Who are they, where did they come from and why? I can only hope they didn't rise up from the grave.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11">
    <text>Yo! Why are you here?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111">
    <text>Yo back! I need to see Nimble. Do you know where I can find him?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_1111">
    <text>Nimble got a raw deal. His group was attacked by some bandits a little ways from here. All he could do was send me an SOS message. It looked like his pals went under. My guys told me these bastards are now at the old car park, the one across the road.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11111">
    <text>You don't rescue your own people from capture? Not what I would call friendly. Or is it that you're just too chicken to do it?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111111">
    <text>I'd punch your lights out, but what's the use! It's not that simple. I got too few people, and even those that I have are mostly rookies. I can't take that risk of getting them killed. If we lose this camp then things will get even worse for all the stalkers out there. And what about yourself? If you aren't too scared, I won't let my pride make me say no to a helping hand. So will you help me deal with these thugs?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_1111111">
    <text>Do you think I could do it alone?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11111111">
    <text>Nope you stand no chance by yourself. My scouts out there are good soldiers and right now they're near those freaks. Together you can pull it off. What do you think? You got the guts?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111111111">
    <text>I'll try.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_1111111111">
    <text>Way to go! Alright, I gave you my guys' coordinates. I'll let them know your on your way.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111111112">
    <text>I got the balls, but I won't do it.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111111121">
    <text>Yeah, like hell you do. Fine then get lost!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_21">
    <text>So how is it going?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_211">
    <text>Your guys and I made it. Everything is aok at the car park.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_2111">
    <text>That's awesome man! Here take this. That's my personal reward for you.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_212">
    <text>We went over the car park with a fine-toothed comb. It's all clear now.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_2121">
    <text>Wow! My men tell me you gave them a real beating! Here take this money. Just a memento not counting our huge gratitude. Plus I got something else for you here.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_21211">
    <text>Hey!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_213">
    <text>I'm working on it!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_2131">
    <text>Keep me posted ok?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_31">
    <text>I can't waste time on idle chit-chat. Take a hike!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_311">
    <text>I understand, I'm not stupid.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_41">
    <text>Hello Strelok. What's the occasion?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_51">
    <text>Tell me something new stalker.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_511">
    <text>What can I tell you. There were bandits at the car park, so we did some cleaning up. That's about it.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_5111">
    <text>You aren't the bragging kind are you. Look, since you've dealt with these thugs, I can't just let you go like that.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_11">
    <text>Thanks brother! You did us a great service. I don't even know how to thank you.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_111">
    <text>Listen, I need that flash drive you were taking to the trader about. Do you have it?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_1111">
    <text>Yes I have it. Those morons can't even do a proper search. Well what the heck, take it! After all you saved my life. It was well hidden, but these thugs can't frisk for shit.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_11111">
    <text>Thanks. Where did you keep it anyway? Er, maybe I shouldn't ask. Who knows, that idea might come in handy.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_111111">
    <text>I didn't keep it down there so don't worry. I've worked for Trader for a long time so I can store information safely. By the way I told the thugs a nice little story about a cache full of artifacts and they ordered one guy to go there. The cache exists, but it's only got one artifact. I can give you its coordinates if you want.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_21">
    <text>Have a safe trip Strelok!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_311">
    <text>Sure, thanks.</text>
</string>

    <text>But don't forget that there's lots of wild animals there. Besides, the gangster they sent is armed with more than a knife and a fork, so be careful. Thanks again.</text>

<string id="escape_shustryi_start_31111">
    <text>Thanks to you, too.</text>

<string id="escape_trader_done_blockpost_box_0">
    <text>Mission complete. Here's the box from the army outpost.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_done_blockpost_box_2">
    <text>You never cease to amaze me Strelok! Hmmm, Im not a brainy guy, I cant read this encrypted mess. Take the box to the Bartend, apparently there is some useful information that will be available to us all. Can you deliver it?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_0">
    <text>Got any special missions for me?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_1">
    <text>Nope, not a thing.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_12">
    <text>What special missions? You haven't even finished the last one!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_5">
    <text>Well here's the deal. A box containing the reports made by an expedition that went deep into the north Zone have been taken to the army outpost. By day it's guarded as if it was filled with pure plutonium, but for some reason at night they only leave two guards on duty.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_51">
    <text>Keep talking.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_511">
    <text>Sneak into the outpost quietly and recover the box. Do that and I'll pay you anything within reason. Will you do it?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_5111">
    <text>I'll try.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_51111">
    <text>I'll get the cash ready, you haven't let me down once. Just one other thing, keep a low profile. If the military gets pissed off we're all in for a lot of trouble.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_52">
    <text>No, I can't get it yet.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_521">
    <text>C'mon man, it's not as bad as it sounds. A bunch of drunk recruits green as grass with a single NCO. Well okay, but I was really counting on you Strelok.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_6">
    <text>Listen Strelok I've done some thinking and here's what I'd like to offer you. Basically what you really need to do is find Strelok. Right?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_61">
    <text>Let's assume I do.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_611">
    <text>Here's the thing about Strelok. There's a stalker that goes by this name. They say he's found a path to the northern reaches of the Zone. And that is a virgin area, a real goldmine for artifacts. Yeah. Anyway I can help you find him. However as you can imagine it won't be a free ride. You'll have to work it off. But in the long run we will both benefit. You're going to waste that Strelok fella and find out what's happened to you. And I'll find, well, I mean I'll get my share of our mutual profit, he-he. So what do you say? Deal?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_6111">
    <text>Continue.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_61111">
    <text>Alright listen. You mean business I can see that. And I mean we need guys like you. We're doing sort of an investigation with some other traders. We want to open up the path to the north, to the center of the Zone. And near the center someone or something is trying to hamper our progress. How the heck this Strelok managed to sneak through I don't know. You see there's this one area where your brain starts boiling. An eerie place. Anyway to cut a long story short a couple of guys have been spying on them grunts for me, not far from here. Apparently the ones at the Agroprom Research Institute have dug up something. Something major. I'm positive it has something to do with the center of the Zone. Anyway, whatever they've dug up it's secured somewhere on the third floor of the Institute. And we really need this. You see what I mean?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_611111">
    <text>Understood.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_6111111">
    <text>Once you have the briefcase don't bring it here. Take it straight to the Barman. He runs the stalker bar, at '100 Rads'. I'll upload the coordinates and all the data you need to your PDA. Clear?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_61111111">
    <text>Got it!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_611111111">
    <text>You'll have to go north through Garbage, then turn West. You'll end up at the Agroprom Research Institute after a few kilometers. And be careful the radiation level is way too high at Garbage. So I suggest you cough up for some antirad or vodka. Well good luck.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_111">
    <text>Got a job for you Strelok. I want you to find a stalker called Nimble, he was carrying some very important information. He disappeared somewhere near the bridge. Find him dead or alive. I don't care. I need the flash drive with the data. Visit Wolf from the local rookie camp and ask him. He could know where that guy is.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_1111">
    <text>Is that it?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_171">
    <text>Hey Strelok, what's up?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_181">
    <text>Strelok what are you doing here? I told you to find Nimble!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_191">
    <text>So, you paid X-18 a visit? Got the documents?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_1911">
    <text>Yeah. Here they are.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_19111">
    <text>Well, well, I see. Now that's interesting, very interesting! If I told anyone they wouldn't believe me! Hmm... yeah... Oh! Would you just look at that! I didn't expect this... it's pretty bad, eh... Well here take these back and give them to the Barkeep. Oh and I owe you for your efforts.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_199">
    <text>Wait, here, take this pistol and ammo. You won't last two seconds in the Zone without a weapon. By the way when you were brought here you had a knife. I took it off you just in case your head wasn't working. You look ok now, so here it is.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_1999">
    <text>Thank man.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_200">
    <text>Well Strelok how is the job going?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_3">
    <text>I need some money. Do you have some work for me.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_300">
    <text>Hey, Strelok! Good timing, I've got a little job for you.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_31">
    <text>Treat me like a rookie. I do not remember a damn thing.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_32">
    <text>And what kind of work is that?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_321">
    <text>Strelok, my men were returning from a job and one of them, called Nimble, had some info for me. He has disappeared somewhere on this side of the bridge. I do not know what to think. I want you to find Nimble, dead or alive. He is one of Wolf's men. Ask him if he probably knows something. He'll have arms and ammunition. He will be able to help you.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_3211">
    <text>Go on.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_32111">
    <text>That's all for now. Bring me the flash drive and we'll consider you for more work.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_321111">
    <text>Ok I'll try.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_33">
    <text>If you want to earn some more money I can tell you how to do that.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_331">
    <text>How?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_3311">
    <text>You can give me some help with an artifact. I'll pay more than other traders.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_33111">
    <text>And where am I going to search for that artifact?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_33112">
    <text>I couldn't be bothered to search for an artifact.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_331111">
    <text>People say that there is a place nearby. There is a rare artifact there called 'Night Star'. If you bring it to me I'll give you a fair amount of money.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_3311111">
    <text>If I find one I'll try not to forget to bring it to you.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_34">
    <text>So what about that artifact I've asked you to find?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_341">
    <text>Here it is. A very interesting thing.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_342">
    <text>What? What artifact? Oh, no, I haven't found it yet.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_3411">
    <text>Excellent, here is your reward.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_34111">
    <text>Thanks.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_4">
    <text>Hey Strelok glad to see you alive.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5">
    <text>Greetings Strelok! Did you manage?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_51">
    <text>Task complete. Here's the artifact.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_511">
    <text>Great Strelok. One more little favor.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5111">
    <text>What favor?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_52">
    <text>The situation has become clear.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_52111">
    <text>Where's a flash drive with the information?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_521111">
    <text>Here it is.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5211111">
    <text>Great.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_521112">
    <text>I don't have it.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5211121">
    <text>That's a pity Strelok, a real pity. We can't talk business until you bring it to me.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_521211">
    <text>Here take it.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5212111">
    <text>Good! We'll consider that you passed the test. I'd suggest you avoid going to the rookie camp for a while.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_56">
    <text>Nothing yet.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_571">
    <text>So did you bring the artifact?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5711">
    <text>Not yet.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_57111">
    <text>Well until you bring it we've got nothing to talk about. Got it?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_6">
    <text>Strelok, I've told you everything already. Get outta here!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_661">
    <text>So Strelok, any news?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_0">
    <text>I need answers to a few questions.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_1">
    <text>Ask away but I don’t know everything. I sit here all day while life goes on outside in the Zone. I can tell you about the Zone in general and a little about the nearby areas where I've been myself.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_100">
    <text>Tell me about the Zone in general.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_101">
    <text>Ask away.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_2">
    <text>What does the army do in the Zone?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_21">
    <text>They guard and protect, what else? No one really knows whether they're guarding the Zone or protecting the rest of the world from it. Sometimes they send whole expeditions here to look for something. But I'll tell you something, they don't respect the Zone and the Zone doesn't like them either, that's why they return home in body bags quite often. What else is there? Well, they look down at everyone and act like gods. They have no respect for stalker rules and won't ever help you even if you're dying right in front of them. They'll gladly shoot you themselves, and they don't get reprimanded for that. I've got a few contacts among them. You know, people always need vodka and, umm, magazines, right? Don't annoy them, they'll whack you for no reason.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3">
    <text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_31">
    <text>The Zone, you see, it's not just a circle of a few kilometers in diameter with a nuclear power plant in the center. It's something bizarre. Really bizarre! I doubt anyone in the world could give you a straight answer. I feel the Zone isn't even part of this world. It's a different world, weird and dangerous and yet attractive too. And you know why? Because with a little luck anyone can get rich quick. And the closer you come to the center of the Zone the higher you will climb on the money ladder.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_311">
    <text>What's so dangerous about this 'different world'?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3111">
    <text>Hmm... well, it's place where you can croak any second and not know what hit you. A dumb soldier's bullet is the least of your problems. Although they've pulled in a lot of military here. Getting shot is basically the most painless kind of death in the Zone. Anomalies, now that's something for ya. To die in an anomaly is a terrible thing indeed. Even mutants try to keep away from them. By the way, mutants, these 'freaks of the Zone', are another kind of trouble, so don't go anywhere unarmed. Anyway, to learn about the other dangers just ask other stalkers.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_312">
    <text>How does one get rich around here?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3121">
    <text>Gee man, what do you think? You don't remember?! Artifacts are the most important thing here. All sorts of weird toys that come from the Zone are worth a fortune in the Mainland. Artifacts are more precious than gold, diamonds and even pure plutonium. Why? Because no jewelry in the world can give you the supernatural powers that the artifacts possess. Just imagine that you can hang a little gadget on your belt that makes bullets curve by and never hit you! What else? Well, you can find bits and pieces even right here. For the most valuable pieces though you'll have to get closer to the center.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_313">
    <text>Does anyone know what's happening in the center of the Zone?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3131">
    <text>It's a different tale every time you hear about something. It's a bunch of fairy tales, except I don't believe all that other worldly nonsense. The one thing I do believe is that the center of the Zone contains a lot of valuable artifacts. Only I haven't met anyone who went there and managed to come back alive.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_4">
    <text>Do you know what happened to me?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_41">
    <text>What kind of question is that? You see, that's some shady business. They found you in a 'Death Truck'. That's a... well, a kind of corpse carrier, right? These trucks come in from the center of the Zone once in a while loaded with bodies. No one really knows where they are heading. So one of them crashed into something and you were found there. This is the most amazing thing of all. We've found broken down corpse carriers before, but no one ever came out of them alive. I'm sorry, bro, that's all I can help you with. The rest you'll have to figure out on your own.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_5">
    <text>Who is Strelok?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_51">
    <text>Yeah, I've heard of a stalker by that name. Rumor is he's one of the few who went to the center of the Zone and made it back. Still, we got so many of these legendary stories about stalker heroes that I can't really guarantee anything is true. At any rate, I've never dealt with him personally. It seems he has his own trading channels. Anyhow, just ask the folks here in the Zone and you'll be sure to learn a lot more.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_6">
    <text>Who is this Ghost stalker?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_61">
    <text>Heh, that's another local legend. We haven't had any news from him in a long time. I suppose he perished somewhere deep in the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_99">
    <text>What's going on in this neighborhood?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_999">
    <text>Huh! This is the entrance to the Zone, a sort of an antechamber. We've got army here in Cordon. It's relatively quiet with the exception of a couple of army guys who like to have some fun, go on shakedown runs. Experienced stalkers don't come by very often, so it's mostly rookies. Some settle here for good, yeah. A little ways from here there's a farm made into a rookie camp. Watch yourself though, they aren't afraid to pull the trigger when push comes to shove. What else? You won't make huge profits here that's for sure. There's a deserted factory across the road. To the north behind the railroad embankment there are the ruins of a farm. An army outpost lies to the south of here. And beware the military left some mines in the ground. Also there used to be a tressel bridge in the center, but it went down somehow. That's about it I guess.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_9991">
    <text>Tell me more about the army outpost.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_99911">
    <text>The few soldiers there have been ordered to shoot on sight. So you'd better walk around it and try not to show your ass. If you piss them off they may call for the Spetsnaz in Cordon. Those guys can brew up such shit that I won't have any customers for a month. I know the commander a little. He likes to take a swig as much as the next man. I'm surviving here thanks to him. So I like to send him a little something once in a while.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_9992">
    <text>I want to know more about the damaged tressel bridge.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_99922">
    <text>That's just a couple of minutes north of here, you'll see it right away. There used to be a bridge over the road, but then it collapsed during one of the blowouts. The army guys built a checkpoint there and don't let anyone through. But if you grease the right palm you can pass with little trouble. In general you don't want to show your face there too much, unless you're badly wounded or got a heavy load on you.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_9993">
    <text>Got some more info about the factory?</text>

</string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_0">
    <text>What are you afraid of?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_1">
    <text>I still can't forget what happened recently. Just listen to this. Once I was walking towards the Garbage, it was dark already. And to be honest, I was really drunk. I decided not to walk around the Zone at night as I could get into an anomaly or some bloody dogs could smell me. I knew I had to find a safe place to sleep for the night. I saw some old, abandoned house, everything was pretty quiet... So I lit a match and headed inside it. I saw a flight of stairs and decided to head up them. I remember there was a hole in the roof where I could see the full moon, and the night sky. The room was full of rags, rubbish, old clothes, a real mess. But it seemed safe, I sat under the whole in the roof, the moon calmed me down, and I fell asleep after a while. Im a light sleeper though. Suddenly I woke up, it was pitch black in the house except for a patch on the floor where the moon shined through the hole in the roof, I could just feel something was wrong, and suddenly I heard a faint, gurgling growl...I looked over my arm slowly, And there I saw it, a freak'n Bloodsucker, sleeping. He was on the other side of the room, with his back to me, my heart pounded, I didn't know what to do, surely he'd hear the steps creak and wake up. So I laid back down, afraid to move a muscle.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_2">
    <text>Well, what happened next?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_3">
    <text>I laid for a while trying to clear my head and think, but it's not easy with something like a Bloodsucker sleeping right next to you! I wondered why it hadn't attacked me, maybe it didn't see me, I don't know. I had to get out of the house though, I had a gun in my bag, but I'd have to crawl to get it, and frankly, I didn't wan't to wake it. I laid down and tried to draw up some courage, I had no choice, I had to do something, I got up slowly, and grabbed my bag, but I stepped on a loose floorboard, and the Bloodsucker jumped, it was awake, I could tell, it's breathing had turned quiet, he was listening for me, he knew he wasn't alone. I made a reach for the bag fast. When the beast heard the noise it jumped up, I managed to pull out my pistol and fire a shot into its chest, I wondered If I had killed it, I soon got my answer, the beast jumped out of the shadows at me, Im not sure how it happened, but It's ugly head wen't through the loop in my bag and got stuck, I took off the bag and fire a round into its leg, and climbed through the hole in the roof, it tried to follow but it still had the bag around his head, and it was pretty full of junk, he looked stuck, it roared and waved its arms trying to free itself. I had a lot of good stuff in that bag though.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_4">
    <text>Your lucky you got out of there.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_5">
    <text>I guess so, but it sucks that I lost my rucksack.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story_0">
    <text>How are you doing?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story_1">
    <text>Im doing alright, If thats possible in the Zone. I heard a story some time ago about a forest surrounding the Psy-Emitter, they say inside it lived the most powerful and good-natured Controller in the Zone. He had never killed anyone, unless it was to save his own life, he usually hid from anybody who happened to come across him, so that no one would open fire on him, people say he's been living off of those mutant dogs. Anyways, they said that the Military was sweeping the area, trying to clean the forest up from the dogs by gunning down the puppies and anything else they could find, they said there were too many of them there. After the clean-up, supposedly only one ugly blind puppy remained. Maybe some more have managed to survive though, anyways, they say this controller was walking through the forest, and found this deformed puppy. The controller took pity in the ugly puppy, and from that point on, the pup was always in the Controllers presence. He raised it, shared his food with it, became the puppies parent. Can you imagine that? A good-natured animal loving Controller?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story_2">
    <text>Well, what happened then?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story_3">
    <text>The two became best friends, they were inseperable! If the Controller went somewhere, the dog was always trotting beside him, they'd venture all around the forest, neither the controller or the puppy have ever openly attacked anyone, nor has anybody bothered the two creatures - however, on a patrol through the forest, some mercenaries had spotted the controller resting against a tree, they opened fire on him. They say the Controller held off the soldiers just long enough for the faithful pup to get to safety, but among the mercenary force were very accurate shooters, and the bullets had found their mark. The controller hit the ground, and became quiet.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story_4">
    <text>How sad, what happened then?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story_5">
    <text>The Controller laid there on the ground, the soil becoming moist and drenched in his blood, he died shorty after. After things calmed down, the dog made his way back to his best friend, who lay dead on the forest floor, it became late and still the dog remained, howling for his best friend, even rain couldn't drown out his cries, weeks and weeks wen't by and the dog howled, but eventually it became quiet. Some people eventually ventured into the forest, some claimed they found the Controllers skeleton, and the puppys as well, they died together, inseperable to the end.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story_6">
    <text>Thats sad, we think the Zone has turned all these creatures fierce and unfeeling, but maybe all of us are just trying to survive...</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_story_0">
    <text>Hey Fox, tell me a story.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_story_1">
    <text>Okay, I had an adventure of sorts... It was before supper, I had just passed the Army post. You know, they are really cheeky these days, they let us pass, but took a lot of money. I had some loot on me and I didn't want a fight, so I payed them. But I was hungry, so hungry I couldn't even wait 'till the rookie camp, so I sat down under a tree and started taking some food out of my rucksack. I won't lie, I had some vodka on me as well. So, I put all that stuff on a newspaper, looked around - birds flying, sun shining. As soon as I opened a can of meat I noticed some rookies about 300 hundred meters away. Well, I put the meat away and grabbed my shotgun, decided to come closer to them. It seemed as though they were coming from the Garbage. Well, they could only do that by finding a hole in the fence. I took out my binoculars, I though it could be one of our guys. But no, these were those god damn vultures, Bandits. And I thought 'Bloody hell! They are going towards the village!'. And it was becoming dark... I realized they wanted to be unexpected. And all I had on me was just a shotgun. I couldn't get to the village before them as they were quite far. Well, I thought, 'Now it's my turn to die. At least I'll die a real Stalker's death.' I told myself.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_story_2">
    <text>Then what happened?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_story_3">
    <text>Well, I remembered that I had a grenade in my rucksack! I don't like those things - I take them out and I realize that it's someone's death, and if you're not agile enough - your own death. But I was there with nothing else I could do and the situation was pretty serious. So I took it out, put my rucksack on the grass and ran after the Bandits. They had their backs turned at me and I was wearing my trainers, so they didn't hear me. Hiding behind trees and bushes I got about ten meters closer to them. I heard them talking. They were very stupid, staying in a big group. Well I thought, 'You haven't much longer to live, being this close'. So I threw the grenade right into the middle of their group! Believe it or not, I got five of them with it, only two were left. One shot at me with his shotgun, but he was disorientated and got his friend instead of me. And I didn't let him get away with that. While he was reloading his shotgun, I got him with my knife. I'm no Indian, but I can throw a knife from two meters away... You don't believe me, do you? If you want to see for yourself, come with me. If I get to that tree there you owe me a bottle of vodka. Yeah though, tactics are a big deal. Imagine me going against them with just a shotgun.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_story_4">
    <text>Yes, grenades they are quite useful at times.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story_0">
    <text>It's so boring in Cordon, got any stories to tell?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story_1">
    <text>I've got a few stories I can tell... Once I came to Sidorovitch's and he told me some foreign tourist was coming to take some photos and see the Zone... He said I needed to organize his trip in the Zone, show him some anomalies, you know, that kind of stuff. And I really needed money at the moment, I had no ammo for my Kalashnikov, shotgun was beat to hell, only had a pistol with blank bullets in the chamber... So, I agreed to give the guy a tour. Not very far, of course, just around the village. So anyways, the guy showed up. In sunglasses, with a camera. Speaking English and smiling like a bastard. Came for a freaking safari. I gestured him to follow. We didn't go very far, our guys just had cleared all the territory before the mill.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story_2">
    <text>Yeah, what happened then?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story_3">
    <text>So, we got to this little hangar, you know, where Fedya Constructor had died? 'Be quiet', I told the guy, 'We are going for some Zombies'. He got the atmosphere of the moment, his eyes became really big and he took out a bloody Magnum from his rucksack. 'Fucking hell!', I thought. 'No, put that gun away', I told him, and I gestured him to follow me. It was dark, nothing visible at all. Water was dripping distantly, windows giving all kinds of wierd sounds, I had nothing to fear though, as you will see. The tourist was shivering and scared out of his mind. Suddenly, a Zombie in camouflage comes out of the darkness and starts walking towards us. The foreigner booked before I even told him to run. Me and the "Zombie" couldn't hold in the laughter! Petrovich, the so called "Zombie", really scared the shit of the client... Took it a bit too far you could say, cause' I was supposed to shoot him with some blanks for realism. Wasn't quick enough though, the tourist took off! It seems as though the tourist has heard of the zombified ones, but as soon as he heard the howling and the guy walking towards us. Well, we got a good amount of money that time.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story_4">
    <text>Yeah, that's funny!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_0">
    <text>Hey, anything interesting happen recently?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_1">
    <text>Listen to this, I was walking through Garbage, it was quite peaceful, but then I noticed there was a dent on the ground, like a Mosquito bald patch. So I threw a bolt at it and I was really shocked! It went through that thing without anything happening! I though it was my mind playing tricks on me, thought I drank a bit too much.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_2">
    <text>Yeah, you must've drank to much.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_3">
    <text>No, what are you talking about? It looked exactly like one, you should know what I'm talking about, it looked exactly like a Mosquito Bald! The ground was lighter, a bit squished on top and some stones pushed into it. The wind was blowing towards it, too.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_4">
    <text>Well, maybe it could've been..</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_5">
    <text>So I sat down and picked up a little stone up from the ground and threw it straight into the Bald. </text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_6">
    <text>And It got crushed into dust?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_7">
    <text>That's what I was hoping to see. But no, the stone just just fell to the ground as though there was no anomaly there. Just fell and that's it. It bugged me, I started to sweat a little. The bolts and the stones should've been destroyed, I figured it had to be a Spec! Anyways, quietly crouching I edged near the Bald, still throwing stones at it to see what would happen.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_8">
    <text>Come on, get on with it.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_9">
    <text>Well, I got right next to it. I was sweating up a storm thinking I was about to be pulled of my feet and crushed to death... But the stones that I threw were right in the middle of the Bald. A voice in my head was telling me to get out of there as quick as possible! Yet I didn't. I had to understand what was happening.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_10">
    <text>Be serious, if you had went any closer you wouldn't be standing here.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_11">
    <text>But I am. Anyways, I put my weapon on my lap and I reached for one of the stones in the Mosquito Bald! So I took it out. It was just like a normal stone.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_12">
    <text>I don't believe it. Tell me what really happened.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_13">
    <text>Well, to my surprise, I was thrown about 5 meters away from the Bald. Shouldn't have touched that stone I guess. The Bald started working, damn thing. While I was up in the air I could see all the stones getting crushed into dust. When I hit the ground, I became unconscious.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_14">
    <text>No way! You had too much to drink.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_15">
    <text>No, Im telling you! Just look at this stone, here!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_16">
    <text>That is kinda wierd, It's hard to believe... But I tell you, your curiosity will kill you one day.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story2_0">
    <text>What do you think about the Zone?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story2_1">
    <text>I have a theory... Not even really a theory, just an idea... What if all this - everything In the Zone, is just some weird experiment on people? Maybe some gray's came down in their UFO's and created it... What? This theory isn't much worse than others... It's interesting: if this is some sort of a experiment, what could they be testing here? Checking perhaps, which artifacts we like better? Maybe all these artifacts are bombs, or alien eggs. And we're spreading them all around the world, in all these laboratories, with rich people buying them... Think about it... I like that idea! "Hey I just bought some weird thing, from some place called "The Zone", paid a lot of money for it too. I guess that makes us cooler then everyone else!". And then one day just fucking blows up in their face! Ha-ha... But to be serious, hell knows what they really are... Only those, who've been past the Radar, could know something. Well, maybe they know, but they aren't very talkative, are they? Only moan. Maybe that's why... Uh, nevermind... That's not funny at all...</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story2_2">
    <text>Yeah that's quite sad. Come on brother let's drink some vodka.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story2_3">
    <text>That's a good idea otherwise more of these weird thoughts come into my head.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_story_0">
    <text>Why aren't there any foreigners in the Zone?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_story_1">
    <text>Okay, I'll answer your question. First of all, why do they need to get in here themselves when they could give a grant to our scientists and they could bring all the results straight to them? Second, to be honest, there were many foreigners here once. It's only the last two years they were afraid to come here. They had a massive failure here. Now all they do is buy materials and information. They pay decent amounts of money though, so many Stalkers work for them, Those damned Bandits as well. You really haven't you heard of that story? </text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_story_2">
    <text>What story?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_story_3">
    <text>You're incredible Strelok! The entire Zone was keeping their ears to the ground about this and you're just now crawling from under the rock. Oh right, your amnesia. Sorry, I forgot. All in all it was a big arrangement. Scientists alone were counting over 30 heads from all over the world, best of the best, all of them. They went through some serious preparations: They had a lot of equipment and were crapping money like there's no tomorrow. Took a platoon of Military specialists for security and three of our guides, loaded everything into shielded BTRs and went off. Well, came back a week later. Found a dozen people in a totally thrashed BTR. Showed up at the fence around the Red forest, straight into the arms of the welcoming party... Bandits, Yeah, their kind don't give a shit what these people been through... Nearly everyone got gunned down. Only three of them have managed to break through the perimeter, two of ours and one egghead. The fella had quite a few screws going loose, so they've quickly hooked him up for a treatment. He's writing a book about the Zone now. Our guys were in a better shape, experience must be worth something. Although they've probably shared their toll as well: one of them went towards the Radar, never to be seen again, and the other one, well, he moved to the Mainland. The rest were consumed by the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_story_4">
    <text>That was some expedition.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_trader_story_5">
    <text>Yeah, it was a complete failure. Have you heard of Town-32? That's where they disappeared. To start off, everything was relatively alright, they were making some researches there, examining anomalies and things like that, But then something wierd started happening, people slowly started to go crazy. Our guy, the one that went to rest, had told me... Some of them just started to scratch their throat open with their nails, others smashed their heads against walls, then some took the easy way out and stuck a gun into their mouth, and then mutants started to attack, people who were still able to think locked themselves up houses. Can you imagine? Outside its pitch black and all these creatures are running amock with people losing their minds one by one. So, in the morning those who didn't go mad had got out of there somehow. The way back was rough, they weren't even following the road, ran through a few anomalies I'd imagine, they got to the Rotten Forest, and those who were left there were never found. Some guys say that the number of Controllers has increased in that area. Since then no one goes into Town-32, If you happen to visit Yantar, ask our scientist Sakharov about it, he was connected to that expedition.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_story2_0">
    <text>What happened to you? What were those things we just killed?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_story2_1">
    <text>Mutants, Blind dogs, those damned white-furred ones. They're wierd, I was shooting at them and it looked like they didn't give a damn. Looks like they don't feel much pain. I was walking from the Garbage after talking to my brother, Serly and they started following me from the woods. I was walking and the woods were dark, I couldn't see anything because of the damn trees. Suddenly, something white shot out of a bush and bit me in the stomach. I didn't even feel the pain, so I shot the dog and tricked the other half of its troop into a Mosquito Bald, ran here, shot a couple more of them... Then I saw a big puddle of blood on the ground. When I bent down a part of my armour fell out of the wound and the blood just started to pour out. They've got bloody good teeth. I've been told of chimeras, and their teeth are even sharper and they'll jump at you as well. I can't thank you enough for helping me out, I really owe you one!</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_fox_story2_2">
    <text>No problem Fox I'm always glad to help a comrade.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story2_0">
    <text>What's with all the mutants around here?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story2_1">
    <text>It's mostly just dogs, but theres a lot of wild boars nearby, be careful. If you meet just one, don't be scared, dodge to the side when it charges, it's not hard, then turn right around and shoot it. That's one less boar in the world. But if there are several of them this tactic might not work. But hey, I warned you...</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story2_2">
    <text>Thanks for the advice.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story2_0">
    <text>What happened to your jacket?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story2_1">
    <text>You wan't to know what happened? Well after I bought the jacket, I realized I was fresh outta cash, so I decided to go out and find some loot. There is lots of places to find money in the Garbage. Without some special protection you'd be dead quite soon though. And I never have had that protection, so my little journey completely failed. I only had an ordinary jacket, and it was full of holes and burns. Where could a rookie get some good protection? The gunshots in the Garbage were still audible, there was a fierce gunfight there. Stalkers were protectiong their camp from arriving bandits. So I was caught in the crossfire: radiation and bandits. So I chose the lesser of two evils. Obviously, I chose the bandits, heavily armed, bloodthirsty and in need for some loot. I had a chance to skip them, but I stood no chance against radiation. You should've seen where I was! I was hiding behind a tree and an expensive artifact was just two steps away from me, but if I started walking to it I'd be dead the same minute, I guarantee it! So I was sitting there under the tree, listening to the gunshots and sounds of the Zone. I had to make a plan of how to get out of there alive and relatively unharmed. My rucksack was thin as a bloodsucker's victim. Only half-full bottle of vodka and two loaves of bread were inside it. I had no ammo so in rage I threw my gun into an anomaly. It quickly shattered in less than a second. I was sitting and thinking there for a long time afterwards. More than an hour. The bandits couldn't see me so I was quietly sitting and thinking. Then I took out my bottle of vodka and some bread. When I took a sip I felt bitterness in my mouth, so I took a big bite of bread. That's how I finished the whole bottle. Suddenly I felt a headache and my eyes blurred. I stood up and ran to the middle of the road like a fool, shaking my hands and my arse.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story2_2">
    <text>Damn, are you insane!? Or just tired of life?</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story2_3">
    <text>It was so weird. I couldn't control myself then. Suddenly something made me run to the gates, which lead to the barn, where bandits and stalkers were fighting. I was running and shouting, but I can't remember what. I was also hopping at the same time, like a little kid. Five bandits with shotguns were just staring at me. I stopped and I couldn't even see them properly, just looked at each one of them with my hands up in the air. With fives gun pointed at me I quickly gained my mind back. I nearly shit myself as well. So, someone smacked me with a the butt end of a shotgun from behind my back and I fell to the ground, still conscious. Then I felt another hit. I was so surprised when I woke up alive near the camp. But those bastards had taken my jacket and I had a terrible headache. But I was alive! I was very happy for that. Without thinking I wen't towards the camp. When people there saw me, they were shocked, I was alive and almost unharmed straight from the bandits. Since then I'm done with long and dangerous expeditions, only walk near the camp and kill dogs, and earn small amounts of money. I tell you, don't go to the Garbage unless you really need to, it's a very dangerous and deadly place. It's a pity I lost that jacket, it was brand new.</text>
</string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_story2_4">
    <text>Nimble, that'll teach you not to drink too much vodka. Remember these words, It'll bring you to your death one day and bandits might not be so merciful next time.</text>
