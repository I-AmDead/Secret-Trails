    <text>Wow!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_chief_start_dialog_100">
    <text>Hi!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_deputy_dialog_1_0">
    <text>Where is the money for the job?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_deputy_dialog_1_100">
    <text>Find my assistant, he will have your money!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_deputy_dialog_1_1000">
    <text>Okay, but this time no cheating!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_1_0">
    <text>Who are you?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_1_10">
    <text>Lecturer they call me! And these ugly varments are my team!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_1_100">
    <text>What are you and your people are doing here?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_1_20">
    <text>Me and the guys are resting here. Need to take a break, then we'll go to Pripyat!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_2_0">
    <text>What do you know of Pripyat?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_2_10">
    <text>I know that it is an old ghost town from way back in the time of Communism. Communism took place because of assholes like Lenin and Stalin. I think now it is swarming with monsters and Monolith in droves. Those who went there before me did not come back!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_2_100">
    <text>Do you think it's very dangerous?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_2_20">
    <text>No doubt, those who went there never returned.</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_0">
    <text>You seen any military nearby?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_10">
    <text>I have not seen any military. However I did hear about some a long time ago.</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_100">
    <text>What did you hear about the military?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_20">
    <text>According to rumors they appeared somewhere in Radar near the antenna. They split up and some continued to Pripyat. We have been here for a day now and have not seen any military. Maybe the road to here is blocked.</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_200">
    <text>So you think the military cut of the road to Radar?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_30">
    <text>Well I suppose they could have. They do not joke around, they are very tough guys and they act quickly and smoothly. It is strange that the way here would be blocked.</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_300">
    <text>Why they did they go to Pripyat?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_3_40">
    <text>I do not know and I am afraid to think what they might be up to. I can only guess what they have in mind.</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_0">
    <text>Maybe you have a job?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_10">
    <text>Well there is one job, but it's not an easy one. You want it?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_100">
    <text>Yes, I'm not scared!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_101">
    <text>Maybe not, but it sure scares me!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_11">
    <text>I understand. Hey, money is money!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_20">
    <text>Well that's good!  The job is to find my scouts Loma and  Beam! They went to Pripyat, I had decided not to go into the jaws of a tiger, so I sent my best guys! Find them, if alive bring them back here, if not bring me their weapons! Do you want this job for 2,000 rubles?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_200">
    <text>Well from your hand to my hand! I mean, ok it's a deal. But can you give a little more money?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_201">
    <text>Give a little more money, let's say 4,000 rubles, okay?</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_21">
    <text>That's plenty for this job!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_find_stalkers_dialog_4_30">
    <text>Ok, I'll wait for you here!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_0">
    <text>Task accomplished!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_100">
    <text>Well give me the PDA!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_1000">
    <text>Hold on, the money first!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_1100">
    <text>A little brazen aren't we, when you consider that the job turned out to be easy!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_1200">
    <text>Easy my ass ... I'll piss on you!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_1300">
    <text>You'll have to catch me first! Maybe I'll piss on you first!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_1400">
    <text>Lol, ok good luck!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_200">
    <text>I can give no more money. If you want you can keep the stuff!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_1_300">
    <text>No money! Free!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_2_0">
    <text>I have not found them!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_deputy_dialog_2_10">
    <text>Find them faster, if you want to get the money!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_1_0">
    <text>I found your guys. They were killed, here are their weapons!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_1_100">
    <text>Thank you! So they died, then I think it makes no sense to go to Pripyat! One problem remains, I cannot give you money for the job. My deputy has disappeared with all the money!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_1_1001">
    <text>Well I'll find him! Tell me where to find him. I hope you are not trying to trick me!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_1_200">
    <text>No! I think he did not get to far yet. I'll mark your map where he might be. I noted here or here! Bring him back, or at least get his PDA and stuff!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_1_2000">
    <text>Well, wait for me!</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_2_0">
    <text>I have not yet found them.</text>
</string>
<string id="rad_found_stalkers_dialog_2_10">
    <text>Seek them quickly! I cannot wait forever here! Good luck!</text>
