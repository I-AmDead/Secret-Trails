    <text>Why not?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_1111">
    <text>Because that's 'Duty' territory, and we're very picky about who we let into the base. If you don't have anything important to discuss with our leaders you ain't getting past.</text>

    <text>We're trying to clear Garbage of bandits. My friends are going to ambush a bandit squad nearby. If we don't stop them they'll take control of Garbage and nobody will be able to go deeper into the Zone. Talk to our commander. He and his men are near here, at the machinery scrapyard. I'm going there myself. We can go together if you want.</text>

    <text>There ain't much to tell man. Garbage is, ah, well, a dump. Duty fighters guard the northern road to the Bar. You might want to avoid them. 'Duty' is full of real nasty types. To the right are the paths into Dark Valley. Note that the radiation levels are very high there. A little closer is the Grimpen Mire. Terrible marshes full of anomalies. They say it's easy to find some decent artifacts there but even easier to find a lot of trouble. Oh well, at least there ain't no Hound of the Baskervilles in the Mire!</text>

<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_3111">
    <text>To the right by the marshes there's a secret hiding place. You'll see a metallic construction overhanging a puddle. My stash is right below it. I put it there a while ago but you saved my life and you probably need it more than I do anyway. So feel free to use it.</text>

    <text>Hey stalker you're just in time! We could really use your help. Those bandit bastards are trying to take control of the Garbage. We had a shootout here half an hour ago and managed to take down three of the dogs. The others retreated but I'm dead certain they are going to come back with reinforcements any minute now. There aren't too many of us left and another man wouldn't hurt.</text>

</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_start_311131">
    <text>Bes is my name. I came to these parts three years ago. Like many of the guys in the Zone I'm a fugitive, wanted for two murders and GBH. A few years ago a friend of mine got battered pretty bad, they had to literally stitch him back together at the hospital. So I paid the bastards who did it a little visit. When the choppers showed up I had to shoot one of them down and jump out of a third-floor window. I've been here since. I've done well in this place but the list of my crimes has got a little longer too. I try to fight the lawless just as I did on the outside. I train rookies and teach them to survive in the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111311">
    <text>So why don't you join Duty if you feel that way?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31113111">
    <text>Duty fights against the Zone. I fight for the people. Besides they're too closely linked with the government and the army. I don't want to wake up in a cold cell one day.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_start_311131111">
    <text>Good luck to you.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31114">
    <text>What's this place?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_start_311141">
    <text>Garbage. We are right at home here. You see the heaps of crap? You don't want to go there, trust me. So full of radioactive waste, the Geiger counters go off the scale. This is the only decent way into the Zone and bandits have been increasingly active here lately. They're shit scared of going deeper into the Zone, into Duty territory, like experienced stalkers. But those hyenas just love robbing the rookies here. So, if nobody else cares, we have to stand our ground and fight ourselves.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111411">
    <text>Go on.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31114111">

    <text>A safe path, stalker. A safe path past the anomalies and straight to the artifacts.</text>

    <text>What can one find in Garbage?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_start_4411">
    <text>You can find a lot of trouble real quick, that's for sure. But since you're such an explorer I'll tell you what I know. To the East there is a little forest. Nothing interesting there and it's full of dogs, so be careful. This railway track will lead you to a tunnel. There are lots of anomalies there, maybe something else too, but I don't know, never really looked very hard. You probably know about the Duty checkpoint in the North. That's basically all I know about this place.</text>

<string id="gar_stalker_about_level_0">
    <text>Can you tell me anything about this place?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_stalker_about_level_1">
    <text>Well listen. Everywhere you look it's a big stinking dump. After the accident in 1986 they brought radioactive waste, cranes and all the destroyed machinery here. Basically, it's full of useless crap and a few anomalies here and there. You can even find some artifacts, but they're not spectacular so that's why you'll mostly find rookies in this place. Lots of rookies means lots of bandits, so it's best not to hang around too long. Further to the East there are loads of radiation pockets; you can't go there without protection. Going South you'll reach the border of the Zone. Go North and you'll eventually reach Rostok factory and the stalker bar. To the East is the Dark Valley, a gloomy, misty place. To the West is the Agroprom Research Institute. I'll mark safe pathways on your map.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111411121">
    <text>In the center there's a large hangar, usually it's pretty quiet there. Worst comes to worst, you can spend the night there. If you go west, in the direction of the Agroprom, there's a bandit camp there, and that's where those freaks that we killed off a while ago were coming from. But I have a feeling that there's more of them there.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_0">
    <text>Do you know anything interesting?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_1">
    <text>I found a rare artifact yesterday, listen, how it was. I was walking around the Military warehouses, through a village. Throwing the bolts as usual, looking at the detector and smoking a cigarette. Suddenly I saw that a bolt that I threw a moment ago does not fall to the ground, just hanging in the air. I was literally shocked. I'm in the Zone for about a year now and I've never seen such a thing! I suppose I was so shocked my brain even stopped working, 'cause I've put my hand into that thing...</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_2">
    <text>How did you feel?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_3">
    <text>It felt as though I've put my hand into some sticky mucus... And I couldn't even pull my hand out! So there I was standing with my hand pulled out, as though I was some sort of beggar.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_4">
    <text>How did you manage to get out?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_5">
    <text>That's what the whole story is about! I've noticed a really weird thing about 30 cantimetres away from my hand. It was spiral with blue droplets on it. And it was shining as well... As though emitting something... So I've started to try and reach that thing really hard... I kept pulling my hand towards it probably for about half an hour. </text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_6">
    <text>The bloodsuckers were probably looking at you as at some kind of a show.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_7">
    <text>Maybe. And a controller was selling the tickets. </text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_8">
    <text>So what happened next?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_9">
    <text>Nothing much. As soon as I've grabbed that thing everything stopped. No mucus. But now I have my own portable matrix.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_10">
    <text>Yeah, that's right. And what shall the artifact be called?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_11">
    <text>I've already found out some info on it. Barman has told me. He didn't know anything about the anomaly, but the artifact is called 'Glass Beads'.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_12">
    <text>Cool.</text>

 <string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_story_0">
    <text>Anything new around here?</text>

<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_story_1">
    <text>Nothing much, really. Hey Strelok have you met the new Spetsnaz soldiers yet?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_story_2">
    <text>No, have you?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_story_3">
    <text>Yep! Recently I had a very romantic and surprising story. So I went for the expedition to the sector near the dungeons. Scientists have asked for a pseudodog's head. Well I've reached the dungeons, hiding near the cars, watching the surroundings with binoculars. Then suddenly I heard a growl right behind me. My hair stood up, my heart sank. I turned round and saw a massive Pseudodog looking straight at me! I suppose it killed many of our guys. I thought it was my turn then. My whole life played through my head, you know, and then, BANG! Its skull cracks, its freaking brain goes everywhere. I was so shocked, just standing there, blinking. Who was my saviour? I saw someone walking out from behind a rubbish container. It was a soldier! With some freaking good armour! Exoskeleton, holding a Dragunov. So he comes up to me and asks 'Who are you?' with computer voice. Well, I was nervous, so I told him everything quickly, 'that scientists have sent me on a mission and I have to find a dead pseudodog'. The next moment he takes off his helmet and I see that it's actually a woman! And she was quite pretty as well!</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_story_4">
    <text>*Laughs* You should've gotten her phone number.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_0">
    <text>It's quite boring around here.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_1">
    <text>Boring you say?! Then listen to this, I had a very strange thing happening to me. Once I was walking through an abandoned village. I've been there many times before... Maybe, you have as well, nearly everyone walks through there. It was becoming dark. Suddenly I saw light coming out of the windows of one of the houses. I was curious about what was there, and the house didn't look abandoned at all. I looked thorugh a window and couldn't see anything, but still it was strange. So, I've decided to walk inside. And as soon as I walked in I was shocked. Everything was so neat and clean. New furniture everywhere, flowers on the windowsill, even a carpet on the floor. That was really weird, I even started wondering whether its old owners had returned, you know, that happens sometimes. I walk into another room and see a table with plates of food on top of it, a decanter with something clear in it. So, I thought that people must be somewhere nearby. I've waited for some time. But I was really hungry, and the soup smelt so good! </text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_2">
    <text>At least tell me a somewhat believable tale.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_3">
    <text>I hadn't smelt anything so tasty in years! I thought to myself, why is there food here if no ones gonna eat it? I wanted to eat it, so I thought, maybe the people who live in there wouldn't be very offended If I take a bit. And, just in case, I could always pay them as well. I sat in an armchair, it was very soft and comfortable, put my shotgun nearby and started to eat. The food was really nice and vodka in the decanter was good as well, not like that rubbish they sell here. I remember that I fell asleep. When I woke up it was morning already. I looked around and... Shit! I found myself sitting in the middle of a dirty hovel on a wooden box. I grabbed my rucksack - the loot and my gun was in place. I was really shocked, I was wondering how I got there. I walked outside and looked around me. The house looked similar but it was all old and rickety, just as all the other houses in that village. I was just standing there puzzled wondering whether I've smoked anything funny the day before. Then after some time I've continued my journey. What do you think and why do things like that happen?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_4">
    <text>I think you were a bit too keen on the vodka that day.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_5">
    <text>What are you talking about? Im a light drinker, and I've never done any drugs or anything. I'm a really healthy person. But how did that happen?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_6">
    <text>Im not sure bro. I think the Zone puts too much strain on our heads. I still have really wierd dreams about the Chernobyl Power Plant, as though I've been there.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story2_0">
    <text>Have you heard of the 'Wish Granter'?</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story2_1">
    <text>Of course! Has the Barman told you those tales? I've even nearly found it once.</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story2_2">
    <text>No way!</text>
</string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story2_3">
    <text>Let a bloodsucker take me if I'm lying! Honestly! Listen, it all started here in Garbage. I was hiding from Piotr. You know that wanker is impossible to work with. I get sick of his babbling, "That's mine, I spotted it first!", then starts shooting in all directions. So. While I was hiding I took a swig of a little too much vodka, you know, I had to protect myself from radiation and then I took a wrong path, ended up in a swamp. I would've sank, but Rad Hoosher saved me and on the way back he told me that Butcher has found the Wish Granter. And that he knows the way to that place, he offered me to go with him, because alone he wouldn't have managed it. And that Stalker, 'Fool' forgot to ask of the path and some mutants attacked us just before the post. I went for the post, cause' all my stuff sank in the swamp, but Rat retreated to the swamp. I haven't seen him since and he didn't have time to tell me the path to the Wish Granter, what a pity. So, that's the story.</text>

<string id="gar_seriy_story2_4">
